    <p class=r>from the war, and sends his mother thetis to ask jove to help the</p>
    <p class=l>in the war of troy, the greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring<br />towns, and taken from thence two beautiful captives, chryseïs and<br />briseïs, allotted the first to agamemnon, and the last to achilles.<br />chryses, the father of chryseïs, and priest of apollo, comes to the<br />grecian camp to ransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in<br />the tenth year of the siege.<br />the priest being refused, and insolently<br />dismissed by agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who<br />inflicts a pestilence on the greeks.<br />achilles calls a council, and<br />encourages chalcas to declare the cause of it; who attributes it to the<br />refusal of chryseïs.<br />the king, being obliged to send back his captive,<br />enters into a furious contest with achilles, which nestor pacifies;<br />however, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on<br />briseïs in revenge.<br />achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his<br />forces from the rest of the greeks; and complaining to thetis, she<br />supplicates jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her<br />son, by giving victory to the trojans.<br />jupiter, granting her suit,<br />incenses juno: between whom the debate runs high, till they are<br />reconciled by the address of vulcan.<br />the time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine<br />during the plague, one in the council and quarrel of the princes,<br />and twelve for jupiter’s stay with the æthiopians, at whose return<br />thetis prefers her petition.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans—scene between jove and juno on olympus.</p>
    <p class=l>the scene lies in the grecian camp,<br />then changes to chrysa, and lastly to olympus.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sing, o goddess, the anger of achilles son of peleus, that</p>
    <p class=l>achilles’ wrath, to greece the direful spring<br />of woes unnumber’d, heavenly goddess, sing!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brought countless ills upon the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>that wrath which hurl’d to pluto’s gloomy reign</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many a brave soul did</p>
    <p class=l>the souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it send hurrying down to hades, and many a hero did it yield a</p>
    <p class=l>whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>prey to dogs and vultures, for so were the counsels of jove</p>
    <p class=l>devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fulfilled from the day on which the son of atreus, king of men,</p>
    <p class=l>[41]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and great achilles, first fell out with one another.</p>
    <p class=l>since great achilles and atrides strove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel?</p>
    <p class=l>such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of jove!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it was</p>
    <p class=l>[42]<br />declare, o muse!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of jove and leto; for he was angry with the king and sent</p>
    <p class=l>in what ill-fated hour[43]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a pestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son</p>
    <p class=l>sprung the fierce strife, from what offended power<br />latona’s son a dire contagion spread,[44]<br />and heap’d the camp with mountains of the dead;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of atreus had dishonoured chryses his priest.</p>
    <p class=l>the king of men his reverent priest defied,[45]<br />and for the king’s offence the people died.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now chryses had</p>
    <p class=l>for chryses sought with costly gifts to gain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come to the ships of the achaeans to free his daughter, and had</p>
    <p class=l>his captive daughter from the victor’s chain.<br />suppliant the venerable father stands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the</p>
    <p class=l>apollo’s awful ensigns grace his hands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sceptre of apollo wreathed with a suppliant’s wreath, and he</p>
    <p class=l>by these he begs; and lowly bending down,<br />extends the sceptre and the laurel crown.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>besought the achaeans, but most of all the two sons of atreus,</p>
    <p class=l>he sued to all, but chief implored for grace<br />the brother-kings, of atreus’ royal race[46]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who were their chiefs.</p>
    <p class=l>“ye kings and warriors!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“sons of atreus,” he cried, “and all other achaeans, may the gods</p>
    <p class=l>may your vows be crown’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who dwell in olympus grant you to sack the city of priam, and to</p>
    <p class=l>and troy’s proud walls lie level with the ground.<br />may jove restore you when your toils are o’er</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>reach your homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a</p>
    <p class=l>safe to the pleasures of your native shore.<br />but, oh!<br />relieve a wretched parent’s pain,<br />and give chryseïs to these arms again;<br />if mercy fail, yet let my presents move,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ransom for her, in reverence to apollo, son of jove.</p>
    <p class=l>and dread avenging phœbus, son of jove.</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this the rest of the achaeans with one voice were for</p>
    <p class=l>the greeks in shouts their joint assent declare,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>respecting the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but</p>
    <p class=l>the priest to reverence, and release the fair.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not so agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly</p>
    <p class=l>not so atrides; he, with kingly pride,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>away.</p>
    <p class=l>repulsed the sacred sire, and thus replied:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“old man,” said he, “let me not find you tarrying about our</p>
    <p class=l>“hence on thy life, and fly these hostile plains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships, nor yet coming hereafter.</p>
    <p class=l>nor ask, presumptuous, what the king detains:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your sceptre of the god and your</p>
    <p class=l>hence, with thy laurel crown, and golden rod,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wreath shall profit you nothing.</p>
    <p class=l>nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will not free her.</p>
    <p class=l>mine is thy daughter, priest, and shall remain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she shall</p>
    <p class=l>and prayers, and tears, and bribes, shall plead in vain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grow old in my house at argos far from her own home, busying</p>
    <p class=l>till time shall rifle every youthful grace,<br />and age dismiss her from my cold embrace,<br />in daily labours of the loom employ’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>herself with her loom and visiting my couch; so go, and do not</p>
    <p class=l>or doom’d to deck the bed she once enjoy’d.<br />hence then; to argos shall the maid retire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>provoke me or it shall be the worse for you.</p>
    <p class=l>far from her native soil and weeping sire.</p>

    <p class=l>”<br />[illustration: ] homer invoking the muse</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the old man feared him and obeyed.</p>
    <p class=l>the trembling priest along the shore return’d,<br />and in the anguish of a father mourn’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not a word he spoke, but went</p>
    <p class=l>disconsolate, not daring to complain,<br />silent he wander’d by the sounding main;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by the shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to king apollo</p>
    <p class=l>till, safe at distance, to his god he prays,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whom lovely leto had borne.</p>
    <p class=l>the god who darts around the world his rays.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“hear me,” he cried, “o god of the</p>
    <p class=l>“o smintheus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>silver bow, that protectest chryse and holy cilla and rulest</p>

    <p class=l>avenge thy servant, and the greeks destroy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he pray, and apollo heard his prayer.</p>
    <p class=l>thus chryses pray’d:—the favouring power attends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he came down<br />furious from the summits of olympus, with his bow and his quiver</p>
    <p class=l>and from olympus’ lofty tops descends.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon his shoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the</p>
    <p class=l>bent was his bow, the grecian hearts to wound;[50]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rage that trembled within him.</p>
    <p class=l>fierce as he moved, his silver shafts resound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he sat himself down away from the</p>
    <p class=l>breathing revenge, a sudden night he spread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships with a face as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death</p>
    <p class=l>and gloomy darkness roll’d about his head.<br />the fleet in view, he twang’d his deadly bow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he shot his arrow in the midst of them.</p>
    <p class=l>and hissing fly the feather’d fates below.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first he smote their</p>
    <p class=l>on mules and dogs the infection first began;[51]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mules and their hounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the</p>
    <p class=l>and last, the vengeful arrows fix’d in man.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>people themselves, and all day long the pyres of the dead were</p>
    <p class=l>for nine long nights, through all the dusky air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>burning.</p>
    <p class=l>the pyres, thick-flaming, shot a dismal glare.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon<br />the tenth day achilles called them in assembly—moved thereto by</p>
    <p class=l>but ere the tenth revolving day was run,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>juno, who saw the achaeans in their death-throes and had</p>
    <p class=l>inspired by juno, thetis’ godlike son</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>compassion upon them.</p>
    <p class=l>convened to council all the grecian train;<br />for much the goddess mourn’d her heroes slain.<br />[52]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then, when they were got together, he rose</p>
    <p class=l>the assembly seated, rising o’er the rest,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and spoke among them.</p>
    <p class=l>achilles thus the king of men address’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“son of atreus,” said he, “i deem that we should now turn roving</p>
    <p class=l>“why leave we not the fatal trojan shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>home if we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by</p>
    <p class=l>and measure back the seas we cross’d before?<br />the plague destroying whom the sword would spare,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>war and pestilence at once.</p>
    <p class=l>’tis time to save the few remains of war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us ask some priest or prophet, or<br />some reader of dreams (for dreams, too, are of jove) who can tell</p>
    <p class=l>but let some prophet, or some sacred sage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>us why phoebus apollo is so angry, and say whether it is for some</p>
    <p class=l>explore the cause of great apollo’s rage;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vow that we have broken, or hecatomb that we have not offered,<br />and whether he will accept the savour of lambs and goats without</p>
    <p class=l>or learn the wasteful vengeance to remove</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>blemish, so as to take away the plague from us.</p>
    <p class=l>by mystic dreams, for dreams descend from jove.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>[53]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he sat down, and calchas son of thestor, wisest</p>
    <p class=l>if broken vows this heavy curse have laid,<br />let altars smoke, and hecatombs be paid.<br />so heaven, atoned, shall dying greece restore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of augurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to</p>
    <p class=l>and phœbus dart his burning shafts no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>speak.</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he it was who had guided the achaeans with their fleet to</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and sat: when chalcas thus replied;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ilius, through the prophesyings with which phoebus apollo had</p>
    <p class=l>chalcas the wise, the grecian priest and guide,<br />that sacred seer, whose comprehensive view,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>inspired him.</p>
    <p class=l>the past, the present, and the future knew:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them</p>
    <p class=l>uprising slow, the venerable sage</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus:—</p>
    <p class=l>thus spoke the prudence and the fears of age:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger</p>
    <p class=l>“beloved of jove, achilles!<br />would’st thou know<br />why angry phœbus bends his fatal bow?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of king apollo, i will therefore do so; but consider first and</p>
    <p class=l>first give thy faith, and plight a prince’s word</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>swear that you will stand by me heartily in word and deed, for i</p>
    <p class=l>of sure protection, by thy power and sword:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>know that i shall offend one who rules the argives with might, to</p>
    <p class=l>for i must speak what wisdom would conceal,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whom all the achaeans are in subjection.</p>
    <p class=l>and truths, invidious to the great, reveal,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a plain man cannot stand</p>
    <p class=l>bold is the task, when subjects, grown too wise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against the anger of a king, who if he swallow his displeasure</p>
    <p class=l>instruct a monarch where his error lies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, will yet nurse revenge till he has wreaked it.<br />consider,</p>
    <p class=l>for though we deem the short-lived fury past,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, whether or no you will protect me.</p>
    <p class=l>’tis sure the mighty will revenge at last.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and achilles answered, “fear not, but speak as it is borne in</p>
    <p class=l>to whom pelides:—“from thy inmost soul<br />speak what thou know’st, and speak without control.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon you from heaven, for by apollo, calchas, to whom you pray,</p>
    <p class=l>e’en by that god i swear who rules the day,<br />to whom thy hands the vows of greece convey.<br />and whose bless’d oracles thy lips declare;<br />long as achilles breathes this vital air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and whose oracles you reveal to us, not a danaan at our ships</p>
    <p class=l>no daring greek, of all the numerous band,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall lay his hand upon you, while i yet live to look upon the</p>
    <p class=l>against his priest shall lift an impious hand;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>face of the earth—no, not though you name agamemnon himself, who</p>
    <p class=l>not e’en the chief by whom our hosts are led,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is by far the foremost of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the king of kings, shall touch that sacred head.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon the seer spoke boldly.<br />“the god,” he said, “is angry</p>
    <p class=l>encouraged thus, the blameless man replies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neither about vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest’s sake, whom</p>
    <p class=l>“nor vows unpaid, nor slighted sacrifice,<br />but he, our chief, provoked the raging pest,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon has dishonoured, in that he would not free his daughter</p>
    <p class=l>apollo’s vengeance for his injured priest.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nor take a ransom for her; therefore has he sent these evils upon</p>
    <p class=l>nor will the god’s awaken’d fury cease,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>us, and will yet send others.</p>
    <p class=l>but plagues shall spread, and funeral fires increase,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he will not deliver the danaans</p>
    <p class=l>till the great king, without a ransom paid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from this pestilence till agamemnon has restored the girl without<br />fee or ransom to her father, and has sent a holy hecatomb to</p>
    <p class=l>to her own chrysa send the black-eyed maid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chryse.</p>
    <p class=l>[54]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus we may perhaps appease him.</p>
    <p class=l>perhaps, with added sacrifice and prayer,<br />the priest may pardon, and the god may spare.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he sat down, and agamemnon rose in anger.</p>
    <p class=l>the prophet spoke: when with a gloomy frown</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his</p>
    <p class=l>the monarch started from his shining throne;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heart was black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he</p>
    <p class=l>black choler fill’d his breast that boil’d with ire,<br />and from his eye-balls flash’d the living fire:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>scowled on calchas and said, “seer of evil, you never yet</p>
    <p class=l>“augur accursed!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>prophesied smooth things concerning me, but have ever loved to</p>
    <p class=l>denouncing mischief still,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foretell that which was evil.</p>

    <p class=l>sent in jove’s anger on a slavish race;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus, henceforward you would insult no man.</p>
    <p class=l>who, lost to sense of generous freedom past,<br />are tamed to wrongs;—or this had been thy last.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore i say,<br />and swear it with a great oath—nay, by this my sceptre which</p>
    <p class=l>now by this sacred sceptre hear me swear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shalt sprout neither leaf nor shoot, nor bud anew from the day on</p>
    <p class=l>which never more shall leaves or blossoms bear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which it left its parent stem upon the mountains—for the axe</p>
    <p class=l>which sever’d from the trunk (as i from thee)<br />on the bare mountains left its parent tree;<br />this sceptre, form’d by temper’d steel to prove</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stripped it of leaf and bark, and now the sons of the achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>an ensign of the delegates of jove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bear it as judges and guardians of the decrees of heaven—so</p>
    <p class=l>from whom the power of laws and justice springs<br />(tremendous oath!<br />inviolate to kings);</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>surely and solemnly do i swear that hereafter they shall look</p>
    <p class=l>by this i swear:—when bleeding greece again</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fondly for achilles and shall not find him.</p>
    <p class=l>shall call achilles, she shall call in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the day of your</p>
    <p class=l>when, flush’d with slaughter, hector comes to spread</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>distress, when your men fall dying by the murderous hand of</p>
    <p class=l>the purpled shore with mountains of the dead,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector, you shall not know how to help them, and shall rend your</p>
    <p class=l>then shalt thou mourn the affront thy madness gave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heart with rage for the hour when you offered insult to the</p>
    <p class=l>forced to deplore when impotent to save:<br />then rage in bitterness of soul to know</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bravest of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>this act has made the bravest greek thy foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this the son of peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke; and furious hurl’d against the ground<br />his sceptre starr’d with golden studs around:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ground and took his seat, while the son of atreus was<br />beginning fiercely from his place upon the other side.</p>
    <p class=l>then sternly silent sat.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then</p>
    <p class=l>with like disdain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>uprose smooth-tongued nestor, the facile speaker of the pylians,</p>
    <p class=l>the raging king return’d his frowns again.<br />to calm their passion with the words of age,<br />slow from his seat arose the pylian sage,<br />experienced nestor, in persuasion skill’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and the words fell from his lips sweeter than honey.</p>
    <p class=l>words, sweet as honey, from his lips distill’d:[58]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two<br />generations of men born and bred in pylos had passed away under</p>
    <p class=l>two generations now had pass’d away,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his rule, and he was now reigning over the third.</p>
    <p class=l>wise by his rules, and happy by his sway;<br />two ages o’er his native realm he reign’d,<br />and now the example of the third remain’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with all</p>
    <p class=l>all view’d with awe the venerable man;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:—</p>
    <p class=l>who thus with mild benevolence began:—</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“of a truth,” he said, “a great sorrow has befallen the achaean</p>
    <p class=l>“what shame, what woe is this to greece!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>land.</p>
    <p class=l>what joy</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>surely priam with his sons would rejoice, and the trojans</p>
    <p class=l>to troy’s proud monarch, and the friends of troy!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be glad at heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two,</p>
    <p class=l>that adverse gods commit to stern debate</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who are so excellent in fight and counsel.</p>
    <p class=l>the best, the bravest, of the grecian state.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i am older than either</p>
    <p class=l>young as ye are, this youthful heat restrain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of you; therefore be guided by me.</p>
    <p class=l>nor think your nestor’s years and wisdom vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moreover i have been the<br />familiar friend of men even greater than you are, and they did</p>
    <p class=l>a godlike race of heroes once i knew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not disregard my counsels.<br />never again can i behold such men as</p>
    <p class=l>such as no more these aged eyes shall view!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pirithous and dryas shepherd of his people, or as caeneus,</p>
    <p class=l>lives there a chief to match pirithous’ fame,<br />dryas the bold, or ceneus’ deathless name;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>exadius, godlike polyphemus, and theseus son of aegeus, peer of</p>
    <p class=l>theseus, endued with more than mortal might,<br />or polyphemus, like the gods in fight?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the immortals.</p>
    <p class=l>with these of old, to toils of battle bred,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these were the mightiest men ever born upon this</p>
    <p class=l>in early youth my hardy days i led;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>earth: mightiest were they, and when they fought the fiercest</p>
    <p class=l>fired with the thirst which virtuous envy breeds,<br />and smit with love of honourable deeds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tribes of mountain savages they utterly overthrew them.</p>
    <p class=l>strongest of men, they pierced the mountain boar,<br />ranged the wild deserts red with monsters’ gore,<br />and from their hills the shaggy centaurs tore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i came</p>
    <p class=l>yet these with soft persuasive arts i sway’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from distant pylos, and went about among them, for they would</p>
    <p class=l>when nestor spoke, they listen’d and obey’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have me come, and i fought as it was in me to do.</p>
    <p class=l>if in my youth, even these esteem’d me wise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not a man now</p>
    <p class=l>do you, young warriors, hear my age advise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>living could withstand them, but they heard my words, and were</p>
    <p class=l>atrides, seize not on the beauteous slave;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>persuaded by them.</p>
    <p class=l>that prize the greeks by common suffrage gave:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so be it also with yourselves, for this is the</p>
    <p class=l>nor thou, achilles, treat our prince with pride;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>more excellent way.</p>
    <p class=l>let kings be just, and sovereign power preside.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, agamemnon, though you be strong,</p>
    <p class=l>thee, the first honours of the war adorn,<br />like gods in strength, and of a goddess born;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>take not this girl away, for the sons of the achaeans have<br />already given her to achilles; and you, achilles, strive not</p>
    <p class=l>him, awful majesty exalts above</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>further with the king, for no man who by the grace of jove wields</p>
    <p class=l>the powers of earth, and sceptred sons of jove.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a sceptre has like honour with agamemnon.</p>
    <p class=l>let both unite with well-consenting mind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you are strong, and</p>
    <p class=l>so shall authority with strength be join’d.<br />leave me, o king!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have a goddess for your mother; but agamemnon is stronger than</p>
    <p class=l>to calm achilles’ rage;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you, for he has more people under him.</p>
    <p class=l>rule thou thyself, as more advanced in age.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of atreus, check your</p>
    <p class=l>forbid it, gods!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>anger, i implore you; end this quarrel with achilles, who in the</p>
    <p class=l>achilles should be lost,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>day of battle is a tower of strength to the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the pride of greece, and bulwark of our host.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and agamemnon answered, “sir, all that you have said is true, but</p>
    <p class=l>this said, he ceased.<br />the king of men replies:<br />“thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.<br />but that imperious, that unconquer’d soul,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this fellow must needs become our lord and master: he must be</p>
    <p class=l>no laws can limit, no respect control.<br />before his pride must his superiors fall;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lord of all, king of all, and captain of all, and this shall</p>
    <p class=l>his word the law, and he the lord of all?<br />him must our hosts, our chiefs, ourself obey?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hardly be.</p>
    <p class=l>what king can bear a rival in his sway?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>granted that the gods have made him a great warrior,</p>
    <p class=l>grant that the gods his matchless force have given;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have they also given him the right to speak with railing?</p>
    <p class=l>has foul reproach a privilege from heaven?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles interrupted him.</p>
    <p class=l>here on the monarch’s speech achilles broke,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“i should be a mean coward,” he cried,</p>
    <p class=l>and furious, thus, and interrupting spoke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“were i to give in to you in all things.</p>
    <p class=l>“tyrant, i well deserved thy galling chain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>order other people<br />about, not me, for i shall obey no longer.</p>
    <p class=l>to live thy slave, and still to serve in vain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>furthermore i say—and</p>
    <p class=l>should i submit to each unjust decree:—</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lay my saying to your heart—i shall fight neither you nor any man</p>
    <p class=l>command thy vassals, but command not me.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about this girl, for those that take were those also that gave.</p>
    <p class=l>seize on briseïs, whom the grecians doom’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but of all else that is at my ship you shall carry away nothing</p>
    <p class=l>my prize of war, yet tamely see resumed;<br />and seize secure; no more achilles draws</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by force.</p>
    <p class=l>his conquering sword in any woman’s cause.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>try, that others may see; if you do, my spear shall be</p>
    <p class=l>the gods command me to forgive the past:<br />but let this first invasion be the last:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>reddened with your blood.</p>
    <p class=l>for know, thy blood, when next thou darest invade,<br />shall stream in vengeance on my reeking blade.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up</p>
    <p class=l>at this they ceased: the stern debate expired:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the assembly at the ships of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the chiefs in sullen majesty retired.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of peleus went</p>
    <p class=l>achilles with patroclus took his way</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>back to his tents and ships with the son of menoetius and his</p>
    <p class=l>where near his tents his hollow vessels lay.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>company, while agamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a</p>
    <p class=l>meantime atrides launch’d with numerous oars</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>crew of twenty oarsmen.</p>
    <p class=l>a well-rigg’d ship for chrysa’s sacred shores:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he escorted chryseis on board and sent</p>
    <p class=l>high on the deck was fair chryseïs placed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moreover a hecatomb for the god.</p>
    <p class=l>and sage ulysses with the conduct graced:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and ulysses went as captain.</p>
    <p class=l>safe in her sides the hecatomb they stow’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea.</p>
    <p class=l>then swiftly sailing, cut the liquid road.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but the son of atreus bade the people purify themselves; so they</p>
    <p class=l>the host to expiate next the king prepares,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>purified themselves and cast their filth into the sea.</p>
    <p class=l>with pure lustrations, and with solemn prayers.<br />wash’d by the briny wave, the pious train[59]<br />are cleansed; and cast the ablutions in the main.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then they</p>
    <p class=l>along the shore whole hecatombs were laid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>offered hecatombs of bulls and goats without blemish on the</p>
    <p class=l>and bulls and goats to phœbus’ altars paid;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sea-shore, and the smoke with the savour of their sacrifice rose</p>
    <p class=l>the sable fumes in curling spires arise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>curling up towards heaven.</p>
    <p class=l>and waft their grateful odours to the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did they busy themselves throughout the host.</p>
    <p class=l>the army thus in sacred rites engaged,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but agamemnon</p>
    <p class=l>atrides still with deep resentment raged.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did not forget the threat that he had made achilles, and called</p>
    <p class=l>to wait his will two sacred heralds stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his trusty messengers and squires talthybius and eurybates.</p>
    <p class=l>talthybius and eurybates the good.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“go,”</p>
    <p class=l>“haste to the fierce achilles’ tent (he cries),</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said he, “to the tent of achilles, son of peleus; take briseis by</p>
    <p class=l>thence bear briseïs as our royal prize:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the hand and bring her hither; if he will not give her i shall</p>
    <p class=l>submit he must; or if they will not part,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come with others and take her—which will press him harder.</p>
    <p class=l>ourself in arms shall tear her from his heart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereon</p>
    <p class=l>the unwilling heralds act their lord’s commands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they went their way sorrowfully by the seaside, till they came to</p>
    <p class=l>pensive they walk along the barren sands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the tents and ships of the myrmidons.<br />they found achilles sitting<br />by his tent and his ships, and ill-pleased he was when he beheld</p>
    <p class=l>arrived, the hero in his tent they find,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them.</p>
    <p class=l>with gloomy aspect on his arm reclined.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they stood fearfully and reverently before him, and never a</p>
    <p class=l>at awful distance long they silent stand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>word did they speak, but he knew them and said, “welcome,</p>
    <p class=l>loth to advance, and speak their hard command;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heralds, messengers of gods and men; draw near; my quarrel is not</p>
    <p class=l>decent confusion!<br />this the godlike man<br />perceived, and thus with accent mild began:<br />“with leave and honour enter our abodes,<br />ye sacred ministers of men and gods!<br />[60]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with you but with agamemnon who has sent you for the girl</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>briseis.</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus, haste, the fair briseïs bring;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, patroclus, bring her and give her to them,</p>
    <p class=l>conduct my captive to the haughty king.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but let them be witnesses by the blessed gods, by mortal men, and</p>
    <p class=l>but witness, heralds, and proclaim my vow,<br />witness to gods above, and men below!<br />but first, and loudest, to your prince declare</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by the fierceness of agamemnon’s anger, that if ever again there</p>
    <p class=l>(that lawless tyrant whose commands you bear),<br />unmoved as death achilles shall remain,<br />though prostrate greece shall bleed at every vein:<br />the raging chief in frantic passion lost,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be need of me to save the people from ruin, they shall seek and<br />they shall not find.<br />agamemnon is mad with rage and knows not how</p>
    <p class=l>blind to himself, and useless to his host,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to look before and after that the achaeans may fight by their</p>
    <p class=l>unskill’d to judge the future by the past,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships in safety.</p>
    <p class=l>in blood and slaughter shall repent at last.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him.</p>
    <p class=l>[illustration: ] the departure of briseis from the tent of achilles</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he brought</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus now the unwilling beauty brought;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>briseis from the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took</p>
    <p class=l>she, in soft sorrows, and in pensive thought,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her with them to the ships of the achaeans—and the woman was loth</p>
    <p class=l>pass’d silent, as the heralds held her hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to go.</p>
    <p class=l>and oft look’d back, slow-moving o’er the strand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then achilles went all alone by the side of the hoar sea,</p>
    <p class=l>not so his loss the fierce achilles bore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>weeping and looking out upon the boundless waste of waters.</p>
    <p class=l>but sad, retiring to the sounding shore,</p>

    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>o’er the wild margin of the deep he hung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>raised his hands in prayer to his immortal mother, “mother,” he</p>
    <p class=l>that kindred deep from whence his mother sprung:[61]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cried, “you bore me doomed to live but for a little season;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>surely jove, who thunders from olympus, might have made that</p>

    <p class=r>as he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she was</p>
    <p class=l>far from the deep recesses of the main,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sitting in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father.</p>

    <p class=l>his beauteous daughter from the victor’s chain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the</p>

    <p class=r>not so agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly</p>
    <p class=l>not so atrides: he, with wonted pride,<br />the sire insulted, and his gifts denied:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>away.<br />so he went back in anger, and apollo, who loved him dearly,</p>
    <p class=l>the insulted sire (his god’s peculiar care)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heard his prayer.</p>
    <p class=l>to phœbus pray’d, and phœbus heard the prayer:</p>

    <p class=r>when they had come inside the harbour they furled the<br />sails and laid them in the ship’s hold; they slackened the<br />forestays, lowered the mast into its place, and rowed the ship to<br />the place where they would have her lie; there they cast out</p>
    <p class=l>the sails they furl’d, they lash the mast aside,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their mooring-stones and made fast the hawsers.</p>

    <p class=l>while thus with arms devoutly raised in air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“hear me,” he cried,</p>
    <p class=l>and solemn voice, the priest directs his prayer:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“o god of the silver bow, that protectest chryse and holy cilla,</p>

    <p class=r>thus did he pray, and apollo heard his prayer.</p>
    <p class=l>so chryses pray’d.<br />apollo heard his prayer:</p>

    <p class=r>when they had done</p>
    <p class=l>and now the greeks their hecatomb prepare;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>praying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads</p>
    <p class=l>between their horns the salted barley threw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the victims and killed and flayed them.</p>
    <p class=l>and, with their heads to heaven, the victims slew:[68]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they cut out the</p>
    <p class=l>the limbs they sever from the inclosing hide;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, set some</p>
    <p class=l>the thighs, selected to the gods, divide:<br />on these, in double cauls involved with art,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pieces of raw meat on the top of them, and then chryses laid them</p>
    <p class=l>the choicest morsels lay from every part.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on the wood fire and poured wine over them, while the young men</p>
    <p class=l>the priest himself before his altar stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands.</p>
    <p class=l>and burns the offering with his holy hands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the</p>
    <p class=l>pours the black wine, and sees the flames aspire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thigh-bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats,</p>
    <p class=l>the youth with instruments surround the fire:<br />the thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they cut the rest up small, put the pieces upon the spits,</p>
    <p class=l>the assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>roasted them till they were done, and drew them off: then, when<br />they had finished their work and the feast was ready, they ate</p>
    <p class=l>then spread the tables, the repast prepare;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied.</p>
    <p class=l>each takes his seat, and each receives his share.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, pages filled the</p>
    <p class=l>when now the rage of hunger was repress’d,<br />with pure libations they conclude the feast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mixing-bowl with wine and water and handed it round, after giving</p>
    <p class=l>the youths with wine the copious goblets crown’d,[69]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>every man his drink-offering.</p>
    <p class=l>and, pleased, dispense the flowing bowls around</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song,<br />hymning him and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god took</p>
    <p class=l>with hymns divine the joyous banquet ends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pleasure in their voices; but when the sun went down, and it came</p>
    <p class=l>the pæans lengthen’d till the sun descends:<br />the greeks, restored, the grateful notes prolong;<br />apollo listens, and approves the song.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on dark, they laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables<br />of the ship, and when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn,</p>
    <p class=l>’twas night; the chiefs beside their vessel lie,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>appeared they again set sail for the host of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>till rosy morn had purpled o’er the sky:</p>

    <p class=r>apollo</p>
    <p class=l>then launch, and hoist the mast: indulgent gales,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sent them a fair wind, so they raised their mast and hoisted</p>
    <p class=l>supplied by phœbus, fill the swelling sails;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their white sails aloft.<br />as the sail bellied with the wind the</p>
    <p class=l>the milk-white canvas bellying as they blow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ship flew through the deep blue water, and the foam hissed</p>
    <p class=l>the parted ocean foams and roars below:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against her bows as she sped onward.</p>
    <p class=l>above the bounding billows swift they flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they reached the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wide-stretching host of the achaeans, they drew the vessel</p>
    <p class=l>far on the beach they haul their bark to land,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ashore, high and dry upon the sands, set her strong props beneath</p>
    <p class=l>(the crooked keel divides the yellow sand,)<br />then part, where stretch’d along the winding bay,</p>

    <p class=r>her, and went their ways to their own tents and ships.</p>
    <p class=l>the ships and tents in mingled prospect lay.</p>

    <p class=r>the dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached</p>

    <p class=r>though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities you.</p>

    <p class=l>awake, but waking this advice approve,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see that it does not escape you.</p>
    <p class=l>and trust the vision that descends from jove.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the dream then left him, and he thought of things that were</p>
    <p class=l>the phantom said; then vanish’d from his sight,<br />resolves to air, and mixes with the night.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>surely not to be accomplished.</p>
    <p class=l>a thousand schemes the monarch’s mind employ;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he thought that on that same day</p>
    <p class=l>elate in thought he sacks untaken troy:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was to take the city of priam, but he little knew what was in</p>
    <p class=l>vain as he was, and to the future blind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the mind of jove, who had many another hard-fought fight in store</p>
    <p class=l>nor saw what jove and secret fate design’d,<br />what mighty toils to either host remain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alike for danaans and trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>what scenes of grief, and numbers of the slain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then presently he woke, with the</p>
    <p class=l>eager he rises, and in fancy hears</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>divine message still ringing in his ears; so he sat upright, and</p>
    <p class=l>the voice celestial murmuring in his ears.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>put on his soft shirt so fair and new, and over this his heavy</p>
    <p class=l>first on his limbs a slender vest he drew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cloak.</p>
    <p class=l>around him next the regal mantle threw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and slung his</p>
    <p class=l>the embroider’d sandals on his feet were tied;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>silver-studded sword about his shoulders; then he took the</p>
    <p class=l>the starry falchion glitter’d at his side;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>imperishable staff of his father, and sallied forth to the ships</p>
    <p class=l>and last, his arm the massy sceptre loads,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>unstain’d, immortal, and the gift of gods.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the goddess dawn now wended her way to vast olympus that she</p>
    <p class=l>now rosy morn ascends the court of jove,<br />lifts up her light, and opens day above.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>might herald day to jove and to the other immortals, and</p>
    <p class=l>the king despatch’d his heralds with commands</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon sent the criers round to call the people in assembly;</p>
    <p class=l>to range the camp and summon all the bands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so they called them and the people gathered thereon.</p>
    <p class=l>the gathering hosts the monarch’s word obey;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but first he</p>
    <p class=l>while to the fleet atrides bends his way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>summoned a meeting of the elders at the ship of nestor king of</p>
    <p class=l>in his black ship the pylian prince he found;<br />there calls a senate of the peers around:<br />the assembly placed, the king of men express’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pylos, and when they were assembled he laid a cunning counsel</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>before them.</p>
    <p class=l>“friends and confederates!<br />with attentive ear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my friends,” said he, “i have had a dream from heaven in the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dead of night, and its face and figure resembled none but</p>
    <p class=l>late as i slumber’d in the shades of night,<br />a dream divine appear’d before my sight;<br />whose visionary form like nestor came,<br />the same in habit, and in mien the same.</p>

    <p class=l>to waste long nights in indolent repose.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>once, for i am a messenger from jove, who, though he be not near,</p>
    <p class=l>’tis jove’s command i bear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yet takes thought for you and pities you.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he bids you get the</p>
    <p class=l>in just array draw forth the embattled train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take troy.</p>
    <p class=l>and lead the grecians to the dusty plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there are</p>
    <p class=l>e’en now, o king!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>no longer divided counsels among the gods; juno has brought them</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>’ the dream then vanished and i awoke.</p>
    <p class=l>the vision spoke, and pass’d in air away.</p>

    <p class=l>now, valiant chiefs!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, therefore, arm the sons of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>since heaven itself alarms,<br />unite, and rouse the sons of greece to arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but it will be well</p>
    <p class=l>but first, with caution, try what yet they dare,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that i should first sound them, and to this end i will tell them</p>
    <p class=l>worn with nine years of unsuccessful war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to fly with their ships; but do you others go about among the</p>
    <p class=l>to move the troops to measure back the main,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>host and prevent their doing so.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then sat down, and nestor the prince of pylos with all<br />sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: “my friends,” said</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, and sat: when nestor, rising said,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he, “princes and councillors of the argives, if any other man of</p>
    <p class=l>(nestor, whom pylos’ sandy realms obey’d,)<br />“princes of greece, your faithful ears incline,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans had told us of this dream we should have declared it</p>
    <p class=l>nor doubt the vision of the powers divine;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>false, and would have had nothing to do with it.</p>
    <p class=l>sent by great jove to him who rules the host,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but he who has</p>
    <p class=l>forbid it, heaven!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seen it is the foremost man among us; we must therefore set about</p>
    <p class=l>this warning should be lost!<br />then let us haste, obey the god’s alarms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>getting the people under arms.</p>
    <p class=l>and join to rouse the sons of greece to arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this he led the way from the assembly, and the other</p>
    <p class=l>thus spoke the sage: the kings without delay</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sceptred kings rose with him in obedience to the word of</p>
    <p class=l>dissolve the council, and their chief obey:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon; but the people pressed forward to hear.</p>
    <p class=l>the sceptred rulers lead; the following host,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they swarmed</p>
    <p class=l>pour’d forth by thousands, darkens all the coast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like bees that sally from some hollow cave and flit in countless</p>
    <p class=l>as from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees<br />clustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>throng among the spring flowers, bunched in knots and clusters;</p>
    <p class=l>rolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so did the mighty multitude pour from ships and tents to the</p>
    <p class=l>with deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>assembly, and range themselves upon the wide-watered shore, while<br />among them ran wildfire rumour, messenger of jove, urging them</p>
    <p class=l>dusky they spread, a close embodied crowd,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ever to the fore.</p>
    <p class=l>and o’er the vale descends the living cloud.<br />[81]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus they gathered in a pell-mell of mad</p>
    <p class=l>so, from the tents and ships, a lengthen’d train</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>confusion, and the earth groaned under the tramp of men as the</p>
    <p class=l>spreads all the beach, and wide o’ershades the plain:<br />along the region runs a deafening sound;<br />beneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground.<br />fame flies before the messenger of jove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>people sought their places.</p>
    <p class=l>and shining soars, and claps her wings above.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nine heralds went crying about among</p>
    <p class=l>nine sacred heralds now, proclaiming loud[82]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them to stay their tumult and bid them listen to the kings, till</p>
    <p class=l>the monarch’s will, suspend the listening crowd.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at last they were got into their several places and ceased their</p>
    <p class=l>soon as the throngs in order ranged appear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>clamour.</p>
    <p class=l>and fainter murmurs died upon the ear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then king agamemnon rose, holding his sceptre.</p>
    <p class=l>the king of kings his awful figure raised:<br />high in his hand the golden sceptre blazed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this was</p>
    <p class=l>the golden sceptre, of celestial flame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the work of vulcan, who gave it to jove the son of saturn.<br />jove</p>
    <p class=l>by vulcan form’d, from jove to hermes came.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gave it to mercury, slayer of argus, guide and guardian.<br />king</p>
    <p class=l>to pelops he the immortal gift resign’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mercury gave it to pelops, the mighty charioteer, and pelops to<br />atreus, shepherd of his people.</p>
    <p class=l>the immortal gift great pelops left behind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus, when he died, left it to</p>
    <p class=l>in atreus’ hand, which not with atreus ends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thyestes, rich in flocks, and thyestes in his turn left it to be</p>
    <p class=l>to rich thyestes next the prize descends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>borne by agamemnon, that he might be lord of all argos and of the</p>
    <p class=l>and now the mark of agamemnon’s reign,<br />subjects all argos, and controls the main.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>isles.</p>
    <p class=l>[83]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>leaning, then, on his sceptre, he addressed the argives.</p>
    <p class=l>on this bright sceptre now the king reclined,<br />and artful thus pronounced the speech design’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my friends,” he said, “heroes, servants of mars, the hand of</p>
    <p class=l>“ye sons of mars, partake your leader’s care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heaven has been laid heavily upon me.</p>
    <p class=l>heroes of greece, and brothers of the war!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cruel jove gave me his</p>
    <p class=l>of partial jove with justice i complain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>solemn promise that i should sack the city of priam before</p>
    <p class=l>and heavenly oracles believed in vain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>returning, but he has played me false, and is now bidding me go</p>
    <p class=l>a safe return was promised to our toils,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ingloriously back to argos with the loss of much people.</p>
    <p class=l>renown’d, triumphant, and enrich’d with spoils.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>such is</p>
    <p class=l>now shameful flight alone can save the host,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the will of jove, who has laid many a proud city in the dust, as</p>
    <p class=l>our blood, our treasure, and our glory lost.<br />so jove decrees, resistless lord of all!<br />at whose command whole empires rise or fall:<br />he shakes the feeble props of human trust,<br />and towns and armies humbles to the dust.<br />what shame to greece a fruitful war to wage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he will yet lay others, for his power is above all.</p>
    <p class=l>oh, lasting shame in every future age!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it will be a</p>
    <p class=l>once great in arms, the common scorn we grow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sorry tale hereafter that an achaean host, at once so great and</p>
    <p class=l>repulsed and baffled by a feeble foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>valiant, battled in vain against men fewer in number than<br />themselves; but as yet the end is not in sight.<br />think that the</p>
    <p class=l>so small their number, that if wars were ceased,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans and trojans have sworn to a solemn covenant, and that</p>
    <p class=l>and greece triumphant held a general feast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they have each been numbered—the trojans by the roll of their<br />householders, and we by companies of ten; think further that each</p>
    <p class=l>all rank’d by tens, whole decades when they dine</p>

    <p class=r>rose heavenward.<br />they cheered each other on to draw the ships</p>
    <p class=l>the doubling clamours echo to the skies.</p>

    <p class=r>troy—bandy-legged, lame of one foot, with his two shoulders<br />rounded and hunched over his chest.</p>
    <p class=l>his mountain shoulders half his breast o’erspread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his head ran up to a point,<br />but there was little hair on the top of it.</p>
    <p class=l>thin hairs bestrew’d his long misshapen head.</p>

    <p class=r>achilles and ulysses</p>
    <p class=l>spleen to mankind his envious heart possess’d,</p>

    <p class=l>long had he lived the scorn of every greek,</p>

    <p class=r>disgusted, yet none the less he kept on brawling and bawling at</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of atreus.</p>
    <p class=l>thus with injurious taunts attack’d the throne.</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and cowering as the dastard bends,<br />the weighty sceptre on his back descends.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>till he dropped and fell a-weeping.</p>
    <p class=l>[88]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the golden sceptre raised a</p>
    <p class=l>on the round bunch the bloody tumours rise:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bloody weal on his back, so he sat down frightened and in pain,</p>
    <p class=l>the tears spring starting from his haggard eyes;<br />trembling he sat, and shrunk in abject fears,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>looking foolish as he wiped the tears from his eyes.</p>
    <p class=l>from his vile visage wiped the scalding tears;<br />while to his neighbour each express’d his thought:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the people</p>
    <p class=l>“ye gods!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were sorry for him, yet they laughed heartily, and one would turn</p>
    <p class=l>what wonders has ulysses wrought!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to his neighbour saying, “ulysses has done many a good thing ere</p>
    <p class=l>what fruits his conduct and his courage yield!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now in fight and council, but he never did the argives a better</p>
    <p class=l>great in the council, glorious in the field.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>turn than when he stopped this fellow’s mouth from prating</p>
    <p class=l>generous he rises in the crown’s defence,<br />to curb the factious tongue of insolence,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>further.</p>
    <p class=l>such just examples on offenders shown,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he will give the kings no more of his insolence.</p>
    <p class=l>sedition silence, and assert the throne.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus said the people.</p>
    <p class=l>’twas thus the general voice the hero praised,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, and</p>
    <p class=l>who, rising, high the imperial sceptre raised:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva in the likeness of a herald bade the people be still,</p>
    <p class=l>the blue-eyed pallas, his celestial friend,<br />(in form a herald,) bade the crowds attend.<br />the expecting crowds in still attention hung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that those who were far off might hear him and consider his</p>
    <p class=l>to hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue.<br />then deeply thoughtful, pausing ere he spoke,<br />his silence thus the prudent hero broke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>council.</p>
    <p class=l>“unhappy monarch!<br />whom the grecian race</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he therefore with all sincerity and goodwill addressed</p>
    <p class=l>with shame deserting, heap with vile disgrace.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them thus:—<br />“king agamemnon, the achaeans are for making you a by-word among</p>
    <p class=l>not such at argos was their generous vow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all mankind.</p>
    <p class=l>once all their voice, but ah!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they forget the promise they made you when they set</p>
    <p class=l>forgotten now:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>out from argos, that you should not return till you had sacked</p>
    <p class=l>ne’er to return, was then the common cry,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the town of troy, and, like children or widowed women, they</p>
    <p class=l>till troy’s proud structures should in ashes lie.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>murmur and would set off homeward.</p>
    <p class=l>behold them weeping for their native shore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>true it is that they have had</p>
    <p class=l>what could their wives or helpless children more?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>toil enough to be disheartened.<br />a man chafes at having to stay</p>
    <p class=l>what heart but melts to leave the tender train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>away from his wife even for a single month, when he is on</p>
    <p class=l>and, one short month, endure the wintry main?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea, but it is now nine long</p>
    <p class=l>few leagues removed, we wish our peaceful seat,<br />when the ship tosses, and the tempests beat:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>years that we have been kept here; i cannot, therefore, blame the</p>
    <p class=l>then well may this long stay provoke their tears,<br />the tedious length of nine revolving years.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans if they turn restive; still we shall be shamed if we go<br />home empty after so long a stay—therefore, my friends, be patient</p>
    <p class=l>not for their grief the grecian host i blame;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yet a little longer that we may learn whether the prophesyings of</p>
    <p class=l>but vanquish’d!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>calchas were false or true.</p>
    <p class=l>baffled!<br />oh, eternal shame!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“all who have not since perished must remember as though it were</p>
    <p class=l>expect the time to troy’s destruction given.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yesterday or the day before, how the ships of the achaeans were</p>
    <p class=l>and try the faith of chalcas and of heaven.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>detained in aulis when we were on our way hither to make war on</p>
    <p class=l>what pass’d at aulis, greece can witness bear,[89]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam and the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>and all who live to breathe this phrygian air.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we were ranged round about a fountain</p>
    <p class=l>beside a fountain’s sacred brink we raised</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>offering hecatombs to the gods upon their holy altars, and there</p>
    <p class=l>our verdant altars, and the victims blazed:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was a fine plane-tree from beneath which there welled a stream of</p>
    <p class=l>’twas where the plane-tree spread its shades around,<br />the altars heaved; and from the crumbling ground</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pure water.</p>
    <p class=l>a mighty dragon shot, of dire portent;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then we saw a prodigy; for jove sent a fearful</p>
    <p class=l>from jove himself the dreadful sign was sent.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>serpent out of the ground, with blood-red stains upon its back,<br />and it darted from under the altar on to the plane-tree.</p>
    <p class=l>straight to the tree his sanguine spires he roll’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now</p>
    <p class=l>and curl’d around in many a winding fold;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there was a brood of young sparrows, quite small, upon the</p>
    <p class=l>the topmost branch a mother-bird possess’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>topmost bough, peeping out from under the leaves, eight in all,<br />and their mother that hatched them made nine.</p>
    <p class=l>eight callow infants fill’d the mossy nest;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the serpent ate the</p>
    <p class=l>herself the ninth; the serpent, as he hung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>poor cheeping things, while the old bird flew about lamenting her</p>
    <p class=l>stretch’d his black jaws and crush’d the crying young;<br />while hovering near, with miserable moan,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>little ones; but the serpent threw his coils about her and caught</p>
    <p class=l>the drooping mother wail’d her children gone.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her by the wing as she was screaming.</p>
    <p class=l>the mother last, as round the nest she flew,<br />seized by the beating wing, the monster slew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then, when he had eaten<br />both the sparrow and her young, the god who had sent him made him</p>
    <p class=l>nor long survived: to marble turn’d, he stands</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>become a sign; for the son of scheming saturn turned him into</p>
    <p class=l>a lasting prodigy on aulis’ sands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stone, and we stood there wondering at that which had come to</p>
    <p class=l>such was the will of jove; and hence we dare</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pass.</p>
    <p class=l>trust in his omen, and support the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seeing, then, that such a fearful portent had broken in</p>
    <p class=l>for while around we gazed with wondering eyes,<br />and trembling sought the powers with sacrifice,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon our hecatombs, calchas forthwith declared to us the oracles</p>
    <p class=l>full of his god, the reverend chalcas cried,[90]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of heaven.</p>
    <p class=l>‘ye grecian warriors!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>‘why, achaeans,’ said he, ‘are you thus speechless?</p>
    <p class=l>lay your fears aside.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove has sent us this sign, long in coming, and long ere it be</p>
    <p class=l>this wondrous signal jove himself displays,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fulfilled, though its fame shall last for ever.</p>
    <p class=l>of long, long labours, but eternal praise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as the serpent<br />ate the eight fledglings and the sparrow that hatched them, which</p>
    <p class=l>as many birds as by the snake were slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>makes nine, so shall we fight nine years at troy, but in the</p>
    <p class=l>so many years the toils of greece remain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tenth shall take the town.</p>
    <p class=l>but wait the tenth, for ilion’s fall decreed:’</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>’ this was what he said, and now it is</p>
    <p class=l>thus spoke the prophet, thus the fates succeed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all coming true.</p>
    <p class=l>obey, ye grecians!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stay here, therefore, all of you, till we take</p>
    <p class=l>with submission wait,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the city of priam.</p>
    <p class=l>nor let your flight avert the trojan fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this the argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again</p>
    <p class=l>he said: the shores with loud applauses sound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with the uproar.</p>
    <p class=l>the hollow ships each deafening shout rebound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nestor, knight of gerene, then addressed them.</p>
    <p class=l>then nestor thus—“these vain debates forbear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“shame on you,” he cried, “to stay talking here like children,<br />when you should fight like men.</p>
    <p class=l>ye talk like children, not like heroes dare.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>where are our covenants now, and</p>
    <p class=l>where now are all your high resolves at last?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>where the oaths that we have taken?</p>
    <p class=l>your leagues concluded, your engagements past?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall our counsels be flung<br />into the fire, with our drink-offerings and the right hands of</p>
    <p class=l>vow’d with libations and with victims then,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fellowship wherein we have put our trust?</p>
    <p class=l>now vanish’d like their smoke: the faith of men!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we waste our time in</p>
    <p class=l>while useless words consume the unactive hours,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>words, and for all our talking here shall be no further forward.</p>
    <p class=l>no wonder troy so long resists our powers.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stand, therefore, son of atreus, by your own steadfast purpose;</p>
    <p class=l>rise, great atrides!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lead the argives on to battle, and leave this handful of men to</p>
    <p class=l>and with courage sway;<br />we march to war, if thou direct the way.<br />but leave the few that dare resist thy laws,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rot, who scheme, and scheme in vain, to get back to argos ere</p>
    <p class=l>the mean deserters of the grecian cause,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they have learned whether jove be true or a liar.<br />for the mighty</p>
    <p class=l>to grudge the conquests mighty jove prepares,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of saturn surely promised that we should succeed, when we</p>
    <p class=l>and view with envy our successful wars.<br />on that great day, when first the martial train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>argives set sail to bring death and destruction upon the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>big with the fate of ilion, plough’d the main,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he showed us favourable signs by flashing his lightning on our</p>
    <p class=l>jove, on the right, a prosperous signal sent,<br />and thunder rolling shook the firmament.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>right hands; therefore let none make haste to go till he has</p>
    <p class=l>encouraged hence, maintain the glorious strife,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first lain with the wife of some trojan, and avenged the toil and</p>
    <p class=l>till every soldier grasp a phrygian wife,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sorrow that he has suffered for the sake of helen.</p>
    <p class=l>till helen’s woes at full revenged appear,<br />and troy’s proud matrons render tear for tear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevertheless,</p>
    <p class=l>before that day, if any greek invite</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if any man is in such haste to be at home again, let him lay his</p>
    <p class=l>his country’s troops to base, inglorious flight,<br />stand forth that greek!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hand to his ship that he may meet his doom in the sight of all.</p>
    <p class=l>and hoist his sail to fly,<br />and die the dastard first, who dreads to die.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but, o king, consider and give ear to my counsel, for the word</p>
    <p class=l>but now, o monarch!<br />all thy chiefs advise:[91]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that i say may not be neglected lightly.</p>
    <p class=l>nor what they offer, thou thyself despise.<br />among those counsels, let not mine be vain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>divide your men,</p>
    <p class=l>in tribes and nations to divide thy train:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon, into their several tribes and clans, that clans and</p>
    <p class=l>his separate troops let every leader call,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tribes may stand by and help one another.</p>
    <p class=l>each strengthen each, and all encourage all.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if you do this, and if</p>
    <p class=l>what chief, or soldier, of the numerous band,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans obey you, you will find out who, both chiefs and</p>
    <p class=l>or bravely fights, or ill obeys command,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>peoples, are brave, and who are cowards; for they will vie</p>
    <p class=l>when thus distinct they war, shall soon be known</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against the other.</p>
    <p class=l>and what the cause of ilion not o’erthrown;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus you shall also learn whether it is</p>
    <p class=l>if fate resists, or if our arms are slow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through the counsel of heaven or the cowardice of man that you<br />shall fail to take the town.</p>
    <p class=l>if gods above prevent, or men below.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and agamemnon answered, “nestor, you have again outdone the sons</p>
    <p class=l>to him the king: “how much thy years excel</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the achaeans in counsel.</p>
    <p class=l>in arts of counsel, and in speaking well!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would, by father jove, minerva, and</p>
    <p class=l>o would the gods, in love to greece, decree</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo, that i had among them ten more such councillors, for the</p>
    <p class=l>but ten such sages as they grant in thee;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>city of king priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we</p>
    <p class=l>such wisdom soon should priam’s force destroy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should sack it.</p>
    <p class=l>and soon should fall the haughty towers of troy!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but the son of saturn afflicts me with bootless</p>
    <p class=l>but jove forbids, who plunges those he hates</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wranglings and strife.</p>
    <p class=l>in fierce contention and in vain debates:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles and i are quarrelling about this</p>
    <p class=l>now great achilles from our aid withdraws,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>girl, in which matter i was the first to offend; if we can be of</p>
    <p class=l>by me provoked; a captive maid the cause:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one mind again, the trojans will not stave off destruction for a</p>
    <p class=l>if e’er as friends we join, the trojan wall</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>day.</p>
    <p class=l>must shake, and heavy will the vengeance fall!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, therefore, get your morning meal, that our hosts join</p>
    <p class=l>but now, ye warriors, take a short repast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in fight.</p>
    <p class=l>and, well refresh’d, to bloody conflict haste.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whet well your spears; see well to the ordering of your</p>
    <p class=l>his sharpen’d spear let every grecian wield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shields; give good feeds to your horses, and look your chariots</p>
    <p class=l>and every grecian fix his brazen shield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>carefully over, that we may do battle the livelong day; for we</p>
    <p class=l>let all excite the fiery steeds of war,<br />and all for combat fit the rattling car.<br />this day, this dreadful day, let each contend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall have no rest, not for a moment, till night falls to part</p>
    <p class=l>no rest, no respite, till the shades descend;<br />till darkness, or till death, shall cover all:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>us.</p>
    <p class=l>let the war bleed, and let the mighty fall;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the bands that bear your shields shall be wet with the sweat</p>
    <p class=l>till bathed in sweat be every manly breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon your shoulders, your hands shall weary upon your spears,</p>
    <p class=l>with the huge shield each brawny arm depress’d,<br />each aching nerve refuse the lance to throw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your horses shall steam in front of your chariots, and if i see</p>
    <p class=l>and each spent courser at the chariot blow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>any man shirking the fight, or trying to keep out of it at the</p>
    <p class=l>who dares, inglorious, in his ships to stay,<br />who dares to tremble on this signal day;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shall be a prey to</p>
    <p class=l>that wretch, too mean to fall by martial power,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dogs and vultures.</p>
    <p class=l>the birds shall mangle, and the dogs devour.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus he spoke, and the achaeans roared applause.</p>
    <p class=l>the monarch spoke; and straight a murmur rose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when the<br />waves run high before the blast of the south wind and break on</p>
    <p class=l>loud as the surges when the tempest blows,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some lofty headland, dashing against it and buffeting it without</p>
    <p class=l>that dash’d on broken rocks tumultuous roar,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ceasing, as the storms from every quarter drive them, even so did</p>
    <p class=l>and foam and thunder on the stony shore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans rise and hurry in all directions to their ships.</p>
    <p class=l>straight to the tents the troops dispersing bend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there they lighted their fires at their tents and got dinner,</p>
    <p class=l>the fires are kindled, and the smokes ascend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>offering sacrifice every man to one or other of the gods, and<br />praying each one of them that he might live to come out of the</p>
    <p class=l>with hasty feasts they sacrifice, and pray,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight.</p>
    <p class=l>to avert the dangers of the doubtful day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed a fat five-year-old</p>
    <p class=l>a steer of five years’ age, large limb’d, and fed,[92]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bull to the mighty son of saturn, and invited the princes and</p>
    <p class=l>to jove’s high altars agamemnon led:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>elders of his host.</p>
    <p class=l>there bade the noblest of the grecian peers;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first he asked nestor and king idomeneus,</p>
    <p class=l>and nestor first, as most advanced in years.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then the two ajaxes and the son of tydeus, and sixthly ulysses,</p>
    <p class=l>next came idomeneus,[93] and tydeus’ son,[94]<br />ajax the less, and ajax telamon;[95]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>peer of gods in counsel; but menelaus came of his own accord, for</p>
    <p class=l>then wise ulysses in his rank was placed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he knew how busy his brother then was.</p>
    <p class=l>and menelaus came, unbid, the last.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they stood round the bull</p>
    <p class=l>[96]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with the barley-meal in their hands, and agamemnon prayed,</p>
    <p class=l>the chiefs surround the destined beast, and take<br />the sacred offering of the salted cake:<br />when thus the king prefers his solemn prayer;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saying, “jove, most glorious, supreme, that dwellest in heaven,</p>
    <p class=l>“o thou!<br />whose thunder rends the clouded air,<br />who in the heaven of heavens hast fixed thy throne,<br />supreme of gods!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and ridest upon the storm-cloud, grant that the sun may not go</p>
    <p class=l>unbounded, and alone!<br />hear!<br />and before the burning sun descends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>down, nor the night fall, till the palace of priam is laid low,</p>
    <p class=l>before the night her gloomy veil extends,<br />low in the dust be laid yon hostile spires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and its gates are consumed with fire.</p>
    <p class=l>be priam’s palace sunk in grecian fires.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grant that my sword may<br />pierce the shirt of hector about his heart, and that full many of</p>
    <p class=l>in hector’s breast be plunged this shining sword,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his comrades may bite the dust as they fall dying round him.</p>
    <p class=l>and slaughter’d heroes groan around their lord!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus he prayed, but the son of saturn would not fulfil his<br />prayer.</p>
    <p class=l>thus prayed the chief: his unavailing prayer</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he accepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased</p>
    <p class=l>great jove refused, and toss’d in empty air:<br />the god averse, while yet the fumes arose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their toil continually.</p>
    <p class=l>prepared new toils, and doubled woes on woes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they had done praying and sprinkling</p>
    <p class=l>their prayers perform’d the chiefs the rite pursue,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the barley-meal upon the victim, they drew back its head, killed<br />it, and then flayed it.</p>
    <p class=l>the barley sprinkled, and the victim slew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped</p>
    <p class=l>the limbs they sever from the inclosing hide,<br />the thighs, selected to the gods, divide.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them round in two layers of fat, and set pieces of raw meat on</p>
    <p class=l>on these, in double cauls involved with art,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the top of them.</p>
    <p class=l>the choicest morsels lie from every part,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these they burned upon the split logs of<br />firewood, but they spitted the inward meats, and held them in the</p>
    <p class=l>from the cleft wood the crackling flames aspire</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flames to cook.</p>
    <p class=l>while the fat victims feed the sacred fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the thigh-bones were burned, and they had<br />tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small, put the</p>
    <p class=l>the thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pieces upon spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew</p>
    <p class=l>the assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them off; then, when they had finished their work and the feast</p>
    <p class=l>then spread the tables, the repast prepare,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, so that<br />all were satisfied.</p>
    <p class=l>each takes his seat, and each receives his share.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as soon as they had had enough to eat and</p>
    <p class=l>soon as the rage of hunger was suppress’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drink, nestor, knight of gerene, began to speak.<br />“king</p>
    <p class=l>the generous nestor thus the prince address’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon,” said he, “let us not stay talking here, nor be slack</p>
    <p class=l>“now bid thy heralds sound the loud alarms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the work that heaven has put into our hands.<br />let the heralds</p>
    <p class=l>and call the squadrons sheathed in brazen arms;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>summon the people to gather at their several ships; we will then</p>
    <p class=l>now seize the occasion, now the troops survey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>go about among the host, that we may begin fighting at once.</p>
    <p class=l>and lead to war when heaven directs the way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he speak, and agamemnon heeded his words.<br />he at once</p>
    <p class=l>he said; the monarch issued his commands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sent the criers round to call the people in assembly.</p>
    <p class=l>straight the loud heralds call the gathering bands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so they<br />called them, and the people gathered thereon.<br />the chiefs about</p>
    <p class=l>the chiefs inclose their king; the hosts divide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of atreus chose their men and marshalled them, while</p>
    <p class=l>in tribes and nations rank’d on either side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva went among them holding her priceless aegis that knows</p>
    <p class=l>high in the midst the blue-eyed virgin flies;<br />from rank to rank she darts her ardent eyes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neither age nor death.</p>
    <p class=l>the dreadful ægis, jove’s immortal shield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from it there waved a hundred tassels of</p>
    <p class=l>blazed on her arm, and lighten’d all the field:<br />round the vast orb a hundred serpents roll’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pure gold, all deftly woven, and each one of them worth a hundred<br />oxen.</p>
    <p class=l>form’d the bright fringe, and seem’d to burn in gold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this she darted furiously everywhere among the hosts</p>
    <p class=l>with this each grecian’s manly breast she warms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the achaeans, urging them forward, and putting courage into<br />the heart of each, so that he might fight and do battle without</p>
    <p class=l>swells their bold hearts, and strings their nervous arms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ceasing.<br />thus war became sweeter in their eyes even than</p>
    <p class=l>no more they sigh, inglorious, to return,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>returning home in their ships.</p>
    <p class=l>but breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when some great forest fire is</p>
    <p class=l>as on some mountain, through the lofty grove,<br />the crackling flames ascend, and blaze above;<br />the fires expanding, as the winds arise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>raging upon a mountain top and its light is seen afar, even so as</p>
    <p class=l>shoot their long beams, and kindle half the skies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they marched the gleam of their armour flashed up into the</p>
    <p class=l>so from the polish’d arms, and brazen shields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>firmament of heaven.</p>
    <p class=l>a gleamy splendour flash’d along the fields.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on the</p>
    <p class=l>not less their number than the embodied cranes,<br />or milk-white swans in asius’ watery plains.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>plain about the waters of cayster, that wing their way hither and</p>
    <p class=l>that, o’er the windings of cayster’s springs,[97]<br />stretch their long necks, and clap their rustling wings,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thither, glorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they</p>
    <p class=l>now tower aloft, and course in airy rounds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>settle till the fen is alive with their screaming.</p>
    <p class=l>now light with noise; with noise the field resounds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even thus did</p>
    <p class=l>thus numerous and confused, extending wide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their tribes pour from ships and tents on to the plain of the</p>
    <p class=l>the legions crowd scamander’s flowery side;[98]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>scamander, and the ground rang as brass under the feet of men and</p>
    <p class=l>with rushing troops the plains are cover’d o’er,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses.</p>
    <p class=l>and thundering footsteps shake the sounding shore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they stood as thick upon the flower-bespangled field as</p>
    <p class=l>along the river’s level meads they stand,<br />thick as in spring the flowers adorn the land,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>leaves that bloom in summer.</p>
    <p class=l>or leaves the trees; or thick as insects play,<br />the wandering nation of a summer’s day:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as countless swarms of flies buzz around a herdsman’s homestead</p>
    <p class=l>that, drawn by milky steams, at evening hours,<br />in gather’d swarms surround the rural bowers;<br />from pail to pail with busy murmur run</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the time of spring when the pails are drenched with milk, even</p>
    <p class=l>the gilded legions, glittering in the sun.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so did the achaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the trojans</p>
    <p class=l>so throng’d, so close, the grecian squadrons stood</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and destroy them.</p>
    <p class=l>in radiant arms, and thirst for trojan blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fight</p>
    <p class=l>each leader now his scatter’d force conjoins</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>began, drafting them out as easily as goatherds draft their</p>
    <p class=l>in close array, and forms the deepening lines.<br />not with more ease the skilful shepherd-swain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flocks when they have got mixed while feeding; and among them</p>
    <p class=l>collects his flocks from thousands on the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went king agamemnon, with a head and face like jove the lord of</p>
    <p class=l>the king of kings, majestically tall,<br />towers o’er his armies, and outshines them all;<br />like some proud bull, that round the pastures leads<br />his subject herds, the monarch of the meads,<br />great as the gods, the exalted chief was seen,<br />his strength like neptune, and like mars his mien;[99]<br />jove o’er his eyes celestial glories spread,<br />and dawning conquest played around his head.<br />say, virgins, seated round the throne divine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thunder, a waist like mars, and a chest like that of neptune.</p>
    <p class=l>all-knowing goddesses!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as</p>
    <p class=l>immortal nine!<br />[100]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some great bull that lords it over the herds upon the plain, even</p>
    <p class=l>since earth’s wide regions, heaven’s umneasur’d height,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so did jove make the son of atreus stand peerless among the</p>
    <p class=l>and hell’s abyss, hide nothing from your sight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>multitude of heroes.</p>
    <p class=l>(we, wretched mortals!</p>

    <p class=l>lost in doubts below,</p>

    <p class=r>me—for you are goddesses and are in all places so that you see<br />all things, while we know nothing but by report—who were the</p>

    <p class=l>o say what heroes, fired by thirst of fame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as for the common soldiers,</p>
    <p class=l>or urged by wrongs, to troy’s destruction came.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were so that i could not name every single one of them<br />though i had ten tongues, and though my voice failed not and my</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevertheless, i will tell the captains of the ships and all the</p>

    <p class=l>sprung from the god by thessalus the king.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and with them there came thirty ships.</p>
    <p class=l>now, muse, recount pelasgic argos’ powers,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>those again who held pelasgic argos, alos, alope, and trachis;</p>
    <p class=l>from alos, alopé, and trechin’s towers:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and those of phthia and hellas the land of fair women, who were</p>
    <p class=l>from phthia’s spacious vales; and hella, bless’d<br />with female beauty far beyond the rest.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>called myrmidons, hellenes, and achaeans; these had fifty ships,</p>
    <p class=l>full fifty ships beneath achilles’ care,<br />the achaians, myrmidons, hellenians bear;<br />thessalians all, though various in their name;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over which achilles was in command.</p>
    <p class=l>the same their nation, and their chief the same.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but they now took no part in</p>
    <p class=l>but now inglorious, stretch’d along the shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the war, inasmuch as there was no one to marshal them; for</p>
    <p class=l>they hear the brazen voice of war no more;<br />no more the foe they face in dire array:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles stayed by his ships, furious about the loss of the girl</p>
    <p class=l>close in his fleet the angry leader lay;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>briseis, whom he had taken from lyrnessus at his own great peril,</p>
    <p class=l>since fair briseïs from his arms was torn,<br />the noblest spoil from sack’d lyrnessus borne,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had sacked lyrnessus and thebe, and had overthrown mynes</p>
    <p class=l>then, when the chief the theban walls o’erthrew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and epistrophus, sons of king evenor, son of selepus.</p>
    <p class=l>and the bold sons of great evenus slew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for her<br />sake achilles was still grieving, but ere long he was again to</p>
    <p class=l>there mourn’d achilles, plunged in depth of care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>join them.</p>
    <p class=l>but soon to rise in slaughter, blood, and war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and those that held phylace and the flowery meadows of pyrasus,</p>
    <p class=l>to these the youth of phylacè succeed,<br />itona, famous for her fleecy breed,<br />and grassy pteleon deck’d with cheerful greens,<br />the bowers of ceres, and the sylvan scenes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sanctuary of ceres; iton, the mother of sheep; antrum upon the</p>
    <p class=l>sweet pyrrhasus, with blooming flowerets crown’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sea, and pteleum that lies upon the grass lands.</p>
    <p class=l>and antron’s watery dens, and cavern’d ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of these brave<br />protesilaus had been captain while he was yet alive, but he was</p>
    <p class=l>these own’d, as chief, protesilas the brave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now lying under the earth.<br />he had left a wife behind him in</p>
    <p class=l>who now lay silent in the gloomy grave:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>phylace to tear her cheeks in sorrow, and his house was only half</p>
    <p class=l>the first who boldly touch’d the trojan shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>finished, for he was slain by a dardanian warrior while leaping</p>
    <p class=l>and dyed a phrygian lance with grecian gore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foremost of the achaeans upon the soil of troy.</p>
    <p class=l>there lies, far distant from his native plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>still, though his</p>
    <p class=l>unfinish’d his proud palaces remain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>people mourned their chieftain, they were not without a leader,</p>
    <p class=l>and his sad consort beats her breast in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for podarces, of the race of mars, marshalled them; he was son of</p>
    <p class=l>his troops in forty ships podarces led,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>iphiclus, rich in sheep, who was the son of phylacus, and he was<br />own brother to protesilaus, only younger, protesilaus being at<br />once the elder and the more valiant.</p>
    <p class=l>iphiclus’ son, and brother to the dead;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so the people were not</p>
    <p class=l>nor he unworthy to command the host;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>without a leader, though they mourned him whom they had lost.</p>
    <p class=l>yet still they mourn’d their ancient leader lost.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with him there came forty ships.</p>
    <p class=l>the men who glaphyra’s fair soil partake,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and those that held pherae by the boebean lake, with boebe,</p>
    <p class=l>where hills incircle bœbe’s lowly lake,<br />where phære hears the neighbouring waters fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glaphyrae, and the populous city of iolcus, these with their</p>
    <p class=l>or proud iölcus lifts her airy wall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eleven ships were led by eumelus, son of admetus, whom alcestis</p>
    <p class=l>in ten black ships embark’d for ilion’s shore,<br />with bold eumelus, whom alcestè bore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bore to him, loveliest of the daughters of pelias.</p>
    <p class=l>all pelias’ race alcestè far outshined,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and those that held methone and thaumacia, with meliboea and</p>
    <p class=l>the grace and glory of the beauteous kind,<br />the troops methonè or thaumacia yields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rugged olizon, these were led by the skilful archer philoctetes,</p>
    <p class=l>olizon’s rocks, or melibœa’s fields,<br />with philoctetes sail’d whose matchless art<br />from the tough bow directs the feather’d dart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and they had seven ships, each with fifty oarsmen all of them</p>
    <p class=l>seven were his ships; each vessel fifty row,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>good archers; but philoctetes was lying in great pain in the</p>
    <p class=l>skill’d in his science of the dart and bow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>island of lemnos, where the sons of the achaeans left him, for he</p>
    <p class=l>but he lay raging on the lemnian ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had been bitten by a poisonous water snake.</p>
    <p class=l>a poisonous hydra gave the burning wound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there he lay sick and</p>
    <p class=l>there groan’d the chief in agonizing pain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sorry, and full soon did the argives come to miss him.</p>
    <p class=l>whom greece at length shall wish, nor wish in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but his<br />people, though they felt his loss were not leaderless, for medon,</p>
    <p class=l>his forces medon led from lemnos’ shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the bastard son of oileus by rhene, set them in array.</p>
    <p class=l>oïleus’ son, whom beauteous rhena bore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>those, again, of tricca and the stony region of ithome, and they</p>
    <p class=l>the œchalian race, in those high towers contain’d<br />where once eurytus in proud triumph reign’d,<br />or where her humbler turrets tricca rears,<br />or where ithome, rough with rocks, appears,<br />in thirty sail the sparkling waves divide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that held oechalia, the city of oechalian eurytus, these were</p>
    <p class=l>which podalirius and machaon guide.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>commanded by the two sons of aesculapius, skilled in the art of</p>
    <p class=l>to these his skill their parent-god imparts,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>healing, podalirius and machaon.</p>
    <p class=l>divine professors of the healing arts.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and with them there came thirty</p>
    <p class=l>the bold ormenian and asterian bands</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships.</p>
    <p class=l>in forty barks eurypylus commands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the men, moreover, of ormenius, and by the fountain of hypereia,</p>
    <p class=l>where titan hides his hoary head in snow,<br />and where hyperia’s silver fountains flow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with those that held asterius, and the white crests of titanus,</p>
    <p class=l>thy troops, argissa, polypœtes leads,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these were led by eurypylus, the son of euaemon, and with them</p>
    <p class=l>and eleon, shelter’d by olympus’ shades,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there came forty ships.<br />those that held argissa and gyrtone, orthe, elone, and the white</p>
    <p class=l>gyrtonè’s warriors; and where orthè lies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>city of oloosson, of these brave polypoetes was leader.</p>
    <p class=l>and oloösson’s chalky cliffs arise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was</p>
    <p class=l>sprung from pirithous of immortal race,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of pirithous, who was son of jove himself, for hippodameia</p>
    <p class=l>the fruit of fair hippodame’s embrace,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bore him to pirithous on the day when he took his revenge on the</p>
    <p class=l>(that day, when hurl’d from pelion’s cloudy head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shaggy mountain savages and drove them from mt.<br />pelion to the<br />aithices.</p>
    <p class=l>to distant dens the shaggy centaurs fled)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but polypoetes was not sole in command, for with him</p>
    <p class=l>with polypœtes join’d in equal sway</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was leonteus, of the race of mars, who was son of coronus, the<br />son of caeneus.<br />and with these there came forty ships.</p>
    <p class=l>leonteus leads, and forty ships obey.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>guneus brought two and twenty ships from cyphus, and he was</p>
    <p class=l>in twenty sail the bold perrhæbians came<br />from cyphus, guneus was their leader’s name.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>followed by the enienes and the valiant peraebi, who dwelt about</p>
    <p class=l>with these the enians join’d, and those who freeze</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wintry dodona, and held the lands round the lovely river</p>
    <p class=l>where cold dodona lifts her holy trees;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>titaresius, which sends its waters into the peneus.</p>
    <p class=l>or where the pleasing titaresius glides,<br />and into peneus rolls his easy tides;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they do not<br />mingle with the silver eddies of the peneus, but flow on the top</p>
    <p class=l>yet o’er the silvery surface pure they flow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of them like oil; for the titaresius is a branch of dread orcus</p>
    <p class=l>the sacred stream unmix’d with streams below,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and of the river styx.</p>
    <p class=l>sacred and awful!<br />from the dark abodes</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the magnetes, prothous son of tenthredon was commander.</p>
    <p class=l>styx pours them forth, the dreadful oath of gods!<br />last, under prothous the magnesians stood,<br />(prothous the swift, of old tenthredon’s blood;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they</p>
    <p class=l>who dwell where pelion, crown’d with piny boughs,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were they that dwelt about the river peneus and mt.</p>
    <p class=l>obscures the glade, and nods his shaggy brows;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pelion.</p>
    <p class=l>or where through flowery tempe peneus stray’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>prothous, fleet of foot, was their leader, and with him there</p>
    <p class=l>(the region stretch’d beneath his mighty shade:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came forty ships.</p>
    <p class=l>in forty sable barks they stemm’d the main;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>such were the chiefs and princes of the danaans.</p>
    <p class=l>such were the chiefs, and such the grecian train.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who, then, o</p>
    <p class=l>say next, o muse!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>muse, was the foremost, whether man or horse, among those that</p>
    <p class=l>of all achaia breeds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>followed after the sons of atreus?</p>
    <p class=l>who bravest fought, or rein’d the noblest steeds?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the horses, those of the son of pheres were by far the finest.</p>
    <p class=l>eumelus’ mares were foremost in the chase,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were driven by eumelus, and were as fleet as birds.</p>
    <p class=l>as eagles fleet, and of pheretian race;<br />bred where pieria’s fruitful fountains flow,<br />and train’d by him who bears the silver bow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they</p>
    <p class=l>fierce in the fight their nostrils breathed a flame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were of the same age and colour, and perfectly matched in height.</p>
    <p class=l>their height, their colour, and their age the same;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo, of the silver bow, had bred them in perea—both of them</p>
    <p class=l>o’er fields of death they whirl the rapid car,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mares, and terrible as mars in battle.</p>
    <p class=l>and break the ranks, and thunder through the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the men, ajax, son of</p>
    <p class=l>ajax in arms the first renown acquired,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>telamon, was much the foremost so long as achilles’ anger lasted,</p>
    <p class=l>while stern achilles in his wrath retired:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for achilles excelled him greatly and he had also better horses;</p>
    <p class=l>(his was the strength that mortal might exceeds,<br />and his the unrivall’d race of heavenly steeds:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but achilles was now holding aloof at his ships by reason of his</p>
    <p class=l>but thetis’ son now shines in arms no more;<br />his troops, neglected on the sandy shore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quarrel with agamemnon, and his people passed their time upon the</p>
    <p class=l>in empty air their sportive javelins throw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sea-shore, throwing discs or aiming with spears at a mark, and in<br />archery.</p>
    <p class=l>or whirl the disk, or bend an idle bow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their horses stood each by his own chariot, champing</p>
    <p class=l>unstain’d with blood his cover’d chariots stand;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lotus and wild celery.</p>
    <p class=l>the immortal coursers graze along the strand;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the chariots were housed under cover, but<br />their owners, for lack of leadership, wandered hither and thither</p>
    <p class=l>but the brave chiefs the inglorious life deplored,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about the host and went not forth to fight.</p>
    <p class=l>and, wandering o’er the camp, required their lord.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus marched the host like a consuming fire, and the earth</p>
    <p class=l>now, like a deluge, covering all around,<br />the shining armies sweep along the ground;<br />swift as a flood of fire, when storms arise,<br />floats the wild field, and blazes to the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>groaned beneath them when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes</p>
    <p class=l>earth groan’d beneath them; as when angry jove<br />hurls down the forky lightning from above,<br />on arimé when he the thunder throws,<br />and fires typhœus with redoubled blows,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the land about typhoeus among the arimi, where they say typhoeus</p>
    <p class=l>where typhon, press’d beneath the burning load,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lies.<br />even so did the earth groan beneath them as they sped over<br />the plain.</p>
    <p class=l>still feels the fury of the avenging god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by jove to tell the bad</p>
    <p class=l>but various iris, jove’s commands to bear,<br />speeds on the wings of winds through liquid air;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>news among the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>in priam’s porch the trojan chiefs she found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were gathered in assembly, old and<br />young, at priam’s gates, and iris came close up to priam,</p>
    <p class=l>the old consulting, and the youths around.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>speaking with the voice of priam’s son polites, who, being fleet</p>
    <p class=l>polites’ shape, the monarch’s son, she chose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of foot, was stationed as watchman for the trojans on the tomb of</p>
    <p class=l>who from æsetes’ tomb observed the foes,[105]<br />high on the mound; from whence in prospect lay</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>old aesyetes, to look out for any sally of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the fields, the tents, the navy, and the bay.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in his</p>
    <p class=l>in this dissembled form, she hastes to bring</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>likeness iris spoke, saying, “old man, you talk idly, as in time</p>
    <p class=l>the unwelcome message to the phrygian king.<br />“cease to consult, the time for action calls;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of peace, while war is at hand.</p>
    <p class=l>war, horrid war, approaches to your walls!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have been in many a battle, but</p>
    <p class=l>assembled armies oft have i beheld;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>never yet saw such a host as is now advancing.</p>
    <p class=l>but ne’er till now such numbers charged a field:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they are crossing<br />the plain to attack the city as thick as leaves or as the sands</p>
    <p class=l>thick as autumnal leaves or driving sand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the sea.</p>
    <p class=l>the moving squadrons blacken all the strand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector, i charge you above all others, do as i say.</p>
    <p class=l>thou, godlike hector!<br />all thy force employ,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there are many allies dispersed about the city of priam from<br />distant places and speaking divers tongues.</p>
    <p class=l>assemble all the united bands of troy;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, let each<br />chief give orders to his own people, setting them severally in</p>
    <p class=l>in just array let every leader call</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>array and leading them forth to battle.</p>
    <p class=l>the foreign troops: this day demands them all!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus she spoke, but hector knew that it was the goddess, and at</p>
    <p class=l>the voice divine the mighty chief alarms;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>once broke up the assembly.</p>
    <p class=l>the council breaks, the warriors rush to arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the men flew to arms; all the gates</p>
    <p class=l>the gates unfolding pour forth all their train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were opened, and the people thronged through them, horse and</p>
    <p class=l>nations on nations fill the dusky plain,<br />men, steeds, and chariots, shake the trembling ground:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foot, with the tramp as of a great multitude.</p>
    <p class=l>the tumult thickens, and the skies resound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon<br />the plain.</p>
    <p class=l>amidst the plain, in sight of ilion, stands</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men call it batieia, but the gods know that it is the</p>
    <p class=l>a rising mount, the work of human hands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tomb of lithe myrine.</p>
    <p class=l>(this for myrinne’s tomb the immortals know,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>here the trojans and their allies divided</p>
    <p class=l>though call’d bateïa in the world below;)<br />beneath their chiefs in martial order here,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their forces.</p>
    <p class=l>the auxiliar troops and trojan hosts appear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam’s son, great hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded the</p>
    <p class=l>the godlike hector, high above the rest,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans, and with him were arrayed by far the greater number and</p>
    <p class=l>shakes his huge spear, and nods his plumy crest:<br />in throngs around his native bands repair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>most valiant of those who were longing for the fray.</p>
    <p class=l>and groves of lances glitter in the air.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the dardanians were led by brave aeneas, whom venus bore to</p>
    <p class=l>divine æneas brings the dardan race,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chromis, and ennomus the augur, led the mysians, but his skill in</p>
    <p class=l>there mighty chromis led the mysian train,<br />and augur ennomus, inspired in vain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>augury availed not to save him from destruction, for he fell by<br />the hand of the fleet descendant of aeacus in the river, where he</p>
    <p class=l>for stern achilles lopp’d his sacred head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>slew others also of the trojans.</p>

    <p class=r>born to him of the gygaean lake.</p>
    <p class=l>born on the banks of gyges’ silent lake.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these led the meonians, who<br />dwelt under mt.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>commanded by nastes and amphimachus, the brave sons of nomion.</p>

    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>naustes the bold, amphimachus the vain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came into the fight with gold about him, like a girl; fool that</p>
    <p class=l>who, trick’d with gold, and glittering on his car,<br />rode like a woman to the field of war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was, his gold was of no avail to save him, for he fell in the</p>
    <p class=l>fool that he was!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>river by the hand of the fleet descendant of aeacus, and achilles</p>
    <p class=l>by fierce achilles slain,<br />the river swept him to the briny main:<br />there whelm’d with waves the gaudy warrior lies</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bore away his gold.</p>
    <p class=l>the valiant victor seized the golden prize.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sarpedon and glaucus led the lycians from their distant land, by</p>

    <p class=r>priam view the achaeans from the wall—the covenant—paris and</p>
    <p class=l>the armies being ready to engage, a single combat is agreed upon<br />between menelaus and paris (by the intervention of hector) for the<br />determination of the war.<br />iris is sent to call helen to behold the<br />fight.<br />she leads her to the walls of troy, where priam sat with his<br />counsellers observing the grecian leaders on the plain below, to whom<br />helen gives an account of the chief of them.<br />the kings on either part</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus fight, and paris is worsted—venus carries him off to</p>
    <p class=l>take the solemn oath for the conditions of the combat.<br />the duel ensues;<br />wherein paris being overcome, he is snatched away in a cloud by venus,</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>and transported to his apartment.<br />she then calls helen from the walls,<br />and brings the lovers together.<br />agamemnon, on the part of the grecians,<br />demands the restoration of helen, and the performance of the articles.<br />the three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout this book.<br />the scene is sometimes in the fields before troy, and sometimes in</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain,</p>
    <p class=l>troy itself.<br />thus by their leaders’ care each martial band</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans advanced as a flight of wild-fowl or cranes that</p>
    <p class=l>moves into ranks, and stretches o’er the land.<br />with shouts the trojans, rushing from afar,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>scream overhead when rain and winter drive them over the flowing</p>
    <p class=l>proclaim their motions, and provoke the war.<br />so when inclement winters vex the plain<br />with piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>waters of oceanus to bring death and destruction on the pygmies,</p>
    <p class=l>to warmer seas the cranes embodied fly,[108]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and they wrangle in the air as they fly; but the achaeans marched</p>
    <p class=l>with noise, and order, through the midway sky;<br />to pigmy nations wounds and death they bring,<br />and all the war descends upon the wing,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>silently, in high heart, and minded to stand by one another.</p>
    <p class=l>but silent, breathing rage, resolved and skill’d[109]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the</p>
    <p class=l>by mutual aids to fix a doubtful field,<br />swift march the greeks: the rapid dust around<br />darkening arises from the labour’d ground.<br />thus from his flaggy wings when notus sheds</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mountain tops, bad for shepherds but better than night for</p>
    <p class=l>a night of vapours round the mountain heads,<br />swift-gliding mists the dusky fields invade,<br />to thieves more grateful than the midnight shade;<br />while scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thieves, and a man can see no further than he can throw a stone,</p>
    <p class=l>lost and confused amidst the thicken’d day:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so rose the dust from under their feet as they made all</p>
    <p class=l>so wrapp’d in gathering dust, the grecian train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>speed over the plain.</p>
    <p class=l>a moving cloud, swept on, and hid the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they were close up with one another, alexandrus came forward</p>
    <p class=l>now front to front the hostile armies stand,<br />eager of fight, and only wait command;<br />when, to the van, before the sons of fame<br />whom troy sent forth, the beauteous paris came:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as champion on the trojan side.</p>
    <p class=l>in form a god!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on his shoulders he bore the skin</p>
    <p class=l>the panther’s speckled hide<br />flow’d o’er his armour with an easy pride:<br />his bended bow across his shoulders flung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of a panther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two</p>
    <p class=l>his sword beside him negligently hung;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spears shod with bronze as a challenge to the bravest of the</p>
    <p class=l>two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans to meet him in single fight.</p>
    <p class=l>and dared the bravest of the grecian race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus saw him thus</p>
    <p class=l>as thus, with glorious air and proud disdain,<br />he boldly stalk’d, the foremost on the plain,<br />him menelaus, loved of mars, espies,<br />with heart elated, and with joyful eyes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stride out before the ranks, and was glad as a hungry lion that</p>
    <p class=l>so joys a lion, if the branching deer,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lights on the carcase of some goat or horned stag, and devours it</p>
    <p class=l>or mountain goat, his bulky prize, appear;<br />eager he seizes and devours the slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there and then, though dogs and youths set upon him.</p>
    <p class=l>press’d by bold youths and baying dogs in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even thus<br />was menelaus glad when his eyes caught sight of alexandrus, for<br />he deemed that now he should be revenged.<br />he sprang, therefore,</p>
    <p class=l>thus fond of vengeance, with a furious bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from his chariot, clad in his suit of armour.</p>
    <p class=l>in clanging arms he leaps upon the ground<br />from his high chariot: him, approaching near,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alexandrus quailed as he saw menelaus come forward, and shrank in</p>
    <p class=l>the beauteous champion views with marks of fear,<br />smit with a conscious sense, retires behind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fear of his life under cover of his men.</p>
    <p class=l>and shuns the fate he well deserved to find.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as one who starts back</p>
    <p class=l>as when some shepherd, from the rustling trees[110]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>affrighted, trembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a</p>
    <p class=l>shot forth to view, a scaly serpent sees,<br />trembling and pale, he starts with wild affright</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>serpent in some mountain glade, even so did alexandrus plunge</p>
    <p class=l>and all confused precipitates his flight:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into the throng of trojan warriors, terror-stricken at the sight</p>
    <p class=l>so from the king the shining warrior flies,<br />and plunged amid the thickest trojans lies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the son of atreus.</p>
    <p class=l>as godlike hector sees the prince retreat,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then hector upbraided him.</p>
    <p class=l>he thus upbraids him with a generous heat:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“paris,” said he, “evil-hearted paris,</p>
    <p class=l>“unhappy paris!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fair to see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you</p>
    <p class=l>[111] but to women brave!<br />so fairly form’d, and only to deceive!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had never been born, or that you had died unwed.</p>
    <p class=l>oh, hadst thou died when first thou saw’st the light,<br />or died at least before thy nuptial rite!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>better so, than</p>
    <p class=l>a better fate than vainly thus to boast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>live to be disgraced and looked askance at.</p>
    <p class=l>and fly, the scandal of thy trojan host.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will not the achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>gods!<br />how the scornful greeks exult to see<br />their fears of danger undeceived in thee!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mock at us and say that we have sent one to champion us who is</p>
    <p class=l>thy figure promised with a martial air,</p>

    <p class=r>fair to see but who has neither wit nor courage?</p>
    <p class=l>but ill thy soul supplies a form so fair.</p>

    <p class=r>did you not,</p>
    <p class=l>in former days, in all thy gallant pride,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>such as you are, get your following together and sail beyond the</p>
    <p class=l>when thy tall ships triumphant stemm’d the tide,<br />when greece beheld thy painted canvas flow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seas?</p>
    <p class=l>and crowds stood wondering at the passing show,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did you not from your a far country carry off a lovely</p>
    <p class=l>say, was it thus, with such a baffled mien,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>woman wedded among a people of warriors—to bring sorrow upon your</p>
    <p class=l>you met the approaches of the spartan queen,</p>

    <p class=r>father, your city, and your whole country, but joy to your</p>
    <p class=l>thus from her realm convey’d the beauteous prize,</p>

    <p class=r>enemies, and hang-dog shamefacedness to yourself?</p>
    <p class=l>and both her warlike lords outshined in helen’s eyes?<br />this deed, thy foes’ delight, thy own disgrace,</p>

    <p class=r>and now can you</p>
    <p class=l>thy father’s grief, and ruin of thy race;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not dare face menelaus and learn what manner of man he is whose</p>
    <p class=l>this deed recalls thee to the proffer’d fight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wife you have stolen?</p>
    <p class=l>or hast thou injured whom thou dar’st not right?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>where indeed would be your lyre and your</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair favour, when you</p>
    <p class=l>thy graceful form instilling soft desire,<br />thy curling tresses, and thy silver lyre,<br />beauty and youth; in vain to these you trust,</p>

    <p class=l>soft moving speech, and pleasing outward show,</p>

    <p class=l>yet, would’st thou have the proffer’d combat stand,</p>

    <p class=r>with menelaus, bid the trojans and achaeans take their seats,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while he and i fight in their midst for helen and all her wealth.</p>
    <p class=l>for beauteous helen and the wealth she brought;</p>

    <p class=r>take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his home, but let</p>
    <p class=l>his be the fair, and his the treasure too.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby you trojans</p>
    <p class=l>thus with a lasting league your toils may cease,<br />and troy possess her fertile fields in peace;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall stay here in troy, while the others go home to argos and</p>
    <p class=l>thus may the greeks review their native shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the land of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more.</p>

    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”<br />he said.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the</p>
    <p class=l>the challenge hector heard with joy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojan ranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back,</p>
    <p class=l>then with his spear restrain’d the youth of troy,<br />held by the midst, athwart; and near the foe</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and they all sat down at his bidding: but the achaeans still</p>
    <p class=l>advanced with steps majestically slow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aimed at him with stones and arrows, till agamemnon shouted to</p>
    <p class=l>while round his dauntless head the grecians pour<br />their stones and arrows in a mingled shower.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them saying, “hold, argives, shoot not, sons of the achaeans;</p>
    <p class=l>then thus the monarch, great atrides, cried:<br />“forbear, ye warriors!<br />lay the darts aside:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector desires to speak.</p>
    <p class=l>a parley hector asks, a message bears;<br />we know him by the various plume he wears.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they ceased taking aim and were still, whereon hector spoke.</p>
    <p class=l>awed by his high command the greeks attend,<br />the tumult silence, and the fight suspend.<br />while from the centre hector rolls his eyes</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“hear from my mouth,” said he, “trojans and achaeans, the saying</p>
    <p class=l>on either host, and thus to both applies:<br />“hear, all ye trojan, all ye grecian bands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of alexandrus, through whom this quarrel has come about.</p>
    <p class=l>what paris, author of the war, demands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he bids</p>
    <p class=l>your shining swords within the sheath restrain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans and achaeans lay their armour upon the ground, while</p>

    <p class=l>here in the midst, in either army’s sight,<br />he dares the spartan king to single fight;<br />and wills that helen and the ravish’d spoil,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wealth.</p>
    <p class=l>that caused the contest, shall reward the toil.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let him who shall be victorious and prove to be the<br />better man take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his</p>
    <p class=l>let these the brave triumphant victor grace,</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till menelaus of</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke: in still suspense on either side</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the loud battle-cry addressed them.</p>
    <p class=l>each army stood: the spartan chief replied:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“and now,” he said, “hear me</p>
    <p class=l>“me too, ye warriors, hear, whose fatal right</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>too, for it is i who am the most aggrieved.</p>
    <p class=l>a world engages in the toils of fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i deem that the<br />parting of achaeans and trojans is at hand, as well it may be,</p>
    <p class=l>to me the labour of the field resign;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seeing how much have suffered for my quarrel with alexandrus and<br />the wrong he did me.</p>
    <p class=l>me paris injured; all the war be mine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let him who shall die, die, and let the</p>
    <p class=l>fall he that must, beneath his rival’s arms;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>others fight no more.</p>
    <p class=l>and live the rest, secure of future harms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bring, then, two lambs, a white ram and a</p>
    <p class=l>two lambs, devoted by your country’s rite,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>black ewe, for earth and sun, and we will bring a third for jove.</p>
    <p class=l>to earth a sable, to the sun a white,<br />prepare, ye trojans!<br />while a third we bring<br />select to jove, the inviolable king.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moreover, you shall bid priam come, that he may swear to the</p>
    <p class=l>let reverend priam in the truce engage,<br />and add the sanction of considerate age;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>covenant himself; for his sons are high-handed and ill to trust,</p>
    <p class=l>his sons are faithless, headlong in debate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and the oaths of jove must not be transgressed or taken in vain.</p>
    <p class=l>and youth itself an empty wavering state;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>young men’s minds are light as air, but when an old man comes he</p>
    <p class=l>cool age advances, venerably wise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>looks before and after, deeming that which shall be fairest upon</p>
    <p class=l>turns on all hands its deep-discerning eyes;<br />sees what befell, and what may yet befall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>both sides.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>concludes from both, and best provides for all.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans and achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they</p>
    <p class=l>the nations hear with rising hopes possess’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thought that they should now have rest.</p>
    <p class=l>and peaceful prospects dawn in every breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they backed their</p>
    <p class=l>within the lines they drew their steeds around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariots toward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their</p>
    <p class=l>and from their chariots issued on the ground;<br />next, all unbuckling the rich mail they wore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>armour, laying it down upon the ground; and the hosts were near</p>
    <p class=l>laid their bright arms along the sable shore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to one another with a little space between them.</p>
    <p class=l>on either side the meeting hosts are seen<br />with lances fix’d, and close the space between.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector sent two</p>
    <p class=l>two heralds now, despatch’d to troy, invite</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>messengers to the city to bring the lambs and to bid priam come,</p>
    <p class=l>the phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while agamemnon told talthybius to fetch the other lamb from the</p>
    <p class=l>talthybius hastens to the fleet, to bring</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships, and he did as agamemnon had said.</p>
    <p class=l>the lamb for jove, the inviolable king.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile iris went to helen in the form of her sister-in-law,</p>
    <p class=l>meantime to beauteous helen, from the skies</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wife of the son of antenor, for helicaon, son of antenor, had</p>
    <p class=l>the various goddess of the rainbow flies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>married laodice, the fairest of priam’s daughters.</p>
    <p class=l>(like fair laodice in form and face,<br />the loveliest nymph of priam’s royal race:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she found her</p>
    <p class=l>her in the palace, at her loom she found;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in her own room, working at a great web of purple linen, on which</p>
    <p class=l>the golden web her own sad story crown’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she was embroidering the battles between trojans and achaeans,</p>
    <p class=l>the trojan wars she weaved (herself the prize)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that mars had made them fight for her sake.</p>
    <p class=l>and the dire triumphs of her fatal eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>iris then came close</p>
    <p class=l>to whom the goddess of the painted bow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>up to her and said, “come hither, child, and see the strange<br />doings of the trojans and achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>“approach, and view the wondrous scene below!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>till now they have been</p>
    <p class=l>[112]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>warring upon the plain, mad with lust of battle, but now they</p>
    <p class=l>each hardy greek, and valiant trojan knight,<br />so dreadful late, and furious for the fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have left off fighting, and are leaning upon their shields,</p>
    <p class=l>now rest their spears, or lean upon their shields;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sitting still with their spears planted beside them.</p>
    <p class=l>ceased is the war, and silent all the fields.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alexandrus</p>
    <p class=l>paris alone and sparta’s king advance,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and menelaus are going to fight about yourself, and you are to be</p>
    <p class=l>in single fight to toss the beamy lance;<br />each met in arms, the fate of combat tries,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the wife of him who is the victor.</p>
    <p class=l>thy love the motive, and thy charms the prize.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus spoke the goddess, and helen’s heart yearned after her</p>
    <p class=l>this said, the many-coloured maid inspires</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>former husband, her city, and her parents.</p>
    <p class=l>her husband’s love, and wakes her former fires;<br />her country, parents, all that once were dear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she threw a white</p>
    <p class=l>rush to her thought, and force a tender tear,<br />o’er her fair face a snowy veil she threw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mantle over her head, and hurried from her room, weeping as she</p>
    <p class=l>and, softly sighing, from the loom withdrew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went, not alone, but attended by two of her handmaids, aethrae,<br />daughter of pittheus, and clymene.<br />and straightway they were at</p>
    <p class=l>her handmaids, clymene and æthra, wait</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the scaean gates.</p>
    <p class=l>her silent footsteps to the scæan gate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the two sages, ucalegon and antenor, elders of the people, were</p>
    <p class=l>there sat the seniors of the trojan race:<br />(old priam’s chiefs, and most in priam’s grace,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seated by the scaean gates, with priam, panthous, thymoetes,</p>
    <p class=l>the king the first; thymœtes at his side;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lampus, clytius, and hiketaon of the race of mars.</p>
    <p class=l>lampus and clytius, long in council tried;<br />panthus, and hicetaon, once the strong;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these were too</p>
    <p class=l>and next, the wisest of the reverend throng,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>old to fight, but they were fluent orators, and sat on the tower</p>
    <p class=l>antenor grave, and sage ucalegon,<br />lean’d on the walls and bask’d before the sun:<br />chiefs, who no more in bloody fights engage,<br />but wise through time, and narrative with age,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like cicales that chirrup delicately from the boughs of some high</p>
    <p class=l>in summer days, like grasshoppers rejoice,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tree in a wood.</p>
    <p class=l>a bloodless race, that send a feeble voice.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they saw helen coming towards the tower,</p>
    <p class=l>these, when the spartan queen approach’d the tower,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they said softly to one another, “small wonder that trojans and</p>
    <p class=l>in secret own’d resistless beauty’s power:<br />they cried, “no wonder[113] such celestial charms</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans should endure so much and so long, for the sake of a</p>
    <p class=l>for nine long years have set the world in arms;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>woman so marvellously and divinely lovely.</p>
    <p class=l>what winning graces!<br />what majestic mien!<br />she moves a goddess, and she looks a queen!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>still, fair though she<br />be, let them take her and go, or she will breed sorrow for us and</p>
    <p class=l>yet hence, o heaven, convey that fatal face,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for our children after us.</p>
    <p class=l>and from destruction save the trojan race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but priam bade her draw nigh.</p>
    <p class=l>the good old priam welcomed her, and cried,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my child,” said he, “take your</p>
    <p class=l>“approach, my child, and grace thy father’s side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seat in front of me that you may see your former husband, your</p>
    <p class=l>see on the plain thy grecian spouse appears,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>kinsmen and your friends.</p>
    <p class=l>the friends and kindred of thy former years.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i lay no blame upon you, it is the</p>
    <p class=l>no crime of thine our present sufferings draws,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gods, not you who are to blame.</p>
    <p class=l>not thou, but heaven’s disposing will, the cause</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it is they that have brought</p>
    <p class=l>the gods these armies and this force employ,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about this terrible war with the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the hostile gods conspire the fate of troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tell me, then, who is</p>
    <p class=l>but lift thy eyes, and say, what greek is he<br />(far as from hence these aged orbs can see)<br />around whose brow such martial graces shine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yonder huge hero so great and goodly?</p>
    <p class=l>so tall, so awful, and almost divine!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have seen men taller by a</p>
    <p class=l>though some of larger stature tread the green,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>head, but none so comely and so royal.</p>
    <p class=l>none match his grandeur and exalted mien:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>surely he must be a king.</p>
    <p class=l>he seems a monarch, and his country’s pride.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“sir,” answered helen, “father of my husband, dear and reverend</p>
    <p class=l>thus ceased the king, and thus the fair replied:<br />“before thy presence, father, i appear,<br />with conscious shame and reverential fear.<br />ah!</p>

    <p class=r>in my eyes, would that i had chosen death rather than to have</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come here with your son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends,<br />my darling daughter, and all the companions of my girlhood.</p>
    <p class=l>my brothers, friends, and daughter left behind,</p>

    <p class=r>but</p>
    <p class=l>false to them all, to paris only kind!</p>

    <p class=r>it was not to be, and my lot is one of tears and sorrow.<br />as for</p>
    <p class=l>for this i mourn, till grief or dire disease</p>

    <p class=r>your question, the hero of whom you ask is agamemnon, son of</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus, a good king and a brave soldier, brother-in-law as surely</p>
    <p class=l>the king of kings, atrides, you survey,<br />great in the war, and great in arts of sway:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as that he lives, to my abhorred and miserable self.</p>
    <p class=l>my brother once, before my days of shame!</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>and oh!<br />that still he bore a brother’s name!<br />”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the old man marvelled at him and said, “happy son of atreus,</p>
    <p class=l>with wonder priam view’d the godlike man,<br />extoll’d the happy prince, and thus began:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>child of good fortune.</p>
    <p class=l>“o bless’d atrides!<br />born to prosperous fate,<br />successful monarch of a mighty state!</p>

    <p class=r>i see that the achaeans are subject to you</p>
    <p class=l>how vast thy empire!<br />of your matchless train</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in great multitudes.</p>
    <p class=l>what numbers lost, what numbers yet remain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when i was in phrygia i saw much horsemen,</p>
    <p class=l>in phrygia once were gallant armies known,<br />in ancient time, when otreus fill’d the throne,<br />when godlike mygdon led their troops of horse,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the people of otreus and of mygdon, who were camping upon the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>banks of the river sangarius; i was their ally, and with them</p>
    <p class=l>and sangar’s stream ran purple with their blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the amazons, peers of men, came up against them, but even</p>
    <p class=l>but far inferior those, in martial grace,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were not so many as the achaeans.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the old man next looked upon ulysses; “tell me,” he said, “who is</p>
    <p class=l>this said, once more he view’d the warrior train;<br />“what’s he, whose arms lie scatter’d on the plain?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that other, shorter by a head than agamemnon, but broader across</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and helen answered, “he is ulysses, a man of great craft, son of</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this antenor said, “madam, you have spoken truly.</p>
    <p class=l>antenor took the word, and thus began:[115]<br />“myself, o king!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses once</p>
    <p class=l>have seen that wondrous man<br />when, trusting jove and hospitable laws,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came here as envoy about yourself, and menelaus with him.</p>
    <p class=l>to troy he came, to plead the grecian cause;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i</p>
    <p class=l>(great menelaus urged the same request;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>received them in my own house, and therefore know both of them by</p>
    <p class=l>my house was honour’d with each royal guest:<br />i knew their persons, and admired their parts,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sight and conversation.</p>
    <p class=l>both brave in arms, and both approved in arts.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they stood up in presence of the</p>
    <p class=l>erect, the spartan most engaged our view;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>assembled trojans, menelaus was the broader shouldered, but when<br />both were seated ulysses had the more royal presence.</p>
    <p class=l>ulysses seated, greater reverence drew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after a</p>
    <p class=l>when atreus’ son harangued the listening train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>time they delivered their message, and the speech of menelaus ran</p>
    <p class=l>just was his sense, and his expression plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trippingly on the tongue; he did not say much, for he was a man<br />of few words, but he spoke very clearly and to the point, though</p>
    <p class=l>his words succinct, yet full, without a fault;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was the younger man of the two; ulysses, on the other hand,</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke no more than just the thing he ought.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he rose to speak, was at first silent and kept his eyes</p>
    <p class=l>but when ulysses rose, in thought profound,[116]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fixed upon the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>his modest eyes he fix’d upon the ground;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there was no play nor graceful movement of<br />his sceptre; he kept it straight and stiff like a man unpractised<br />in oratory—one might have taken him for a mere churl or</p>
    <p class=l>as one unskill’d or dumb, he seem’d to stand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>simpleton; but when he raised his voice, and the words came</p>
    <p class=l>nor raised his head, nor stretch’d his sceptred hand;<br />but, when he speaks, what elocution flows!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>driving from his deep chest like winter snow before the wind,</p>
    <p class=l>soft as the fleeces of descending snows,[117]<br />the copious accents fall, with easy art;<br />melting they fall, and sink into the heart!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then there was none to touch him, and no man thought further of</p>
    <p class=l>wondering we hear, and fix’d in deep surprise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what he looked like.</p>
    <p class=l>our ears refute the censure of our eyes.</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam then caught sight of ajax and asked, “who is that great and</p>
    <p class=l>the king then ask’d (as yet the camp he view’d)<br />“what chief is that, with giant strength endued,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>goodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the</p>
    <p class=l>whose brawny shoulders, and whose swelling chest,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rest of the argives?</p>
    <p class=l>and lofty stature, far exceed the rest?<br />“ajax the great, (the beauteous queen replied,)<br />himself a host: the grecian strength and pride.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>see!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“that,” answered helen, “is huge ajax, bulwark of the achaeans,</p>
    <p class=l>bold idomeneus superior towers</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and on the other side of him, among the cretans, stands idomeneus</p>
    <p class=l>amid yon circle of his cretan powers,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>looking like a god, and with the captains of the cretans round</p>
    <p class=l>great as a god!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him.<br />often did menelaus receive him as a guest in our house when</p>
    <p class=l>i saw him once before,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he came visiting us from crete.</p>
    <p class=l>with menelaus on the spartan shore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i see, moreover, many other</p>
    <p class=l>the rest i know, and could in order name;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans whose names i could tell you, but there are two whom i</p>
    <p class=l>all valiant chiefs, and men of mighty fame.<br />yet two are wanting of the numerous train,<br />whom long my eyes have sought, but sought in vain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can nowhere find, castor, breaker of horses, and pollux the</p>
    <p class=l>castor and pollux, first in martial force,<br />one bold on foot, and one renown’d for horse.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty boxer; they are children of my mother, and own brothers to</p>
    <p class=l>my brothers these; the same our native shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>myself.</p>
    <p class=l>one house contain’d us, as one mother bore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>either they have not left lacedaemon, or else, though</p>
    <p class=l>perhaps the chiefs, from warlike toils at ease,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they have brought their ships, they will not show themselves in</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battle for the shame and disgrace that i have brought upon them.</p>
    <p class=l>perhaps their swords some nobler quarrel draws,<br />ashamed to combat in their sister’s cause.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the</p>
    <p class=l>so spoke the fair, nor knew her brothers’ doom;[118]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>earth in their own land of lacedaemon.</p>
    <p class=l>wrapt in the cold embraces of the tomb;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offerings</p>
    <p class=l>adorn’d with honours in their native shore,<br />silent they slept, and heard of wars no more.<br />meantime the heralds, through the crowded town,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through the city—two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of</p>

    <p class=r>earth; and idaeus brought the mixing-bowl and the cups of gold.</p>
    <p class=l>idæus’ arms the golden goblets press’d,[119]</p>

    <p class=r>he went up to priam and said, “son of laomedon, the princes of</p>

    <p class=l>and who his rival shall in arms subdue,<br />his be the dame, and his the treasure too.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we are to swear to a solemn covenant</p>
    <p class=l>thus with a lasting league our toils may cease,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of peace whereby we others shall dwell here in troy, while the</p>

    <p class=r>achaeans return to argos and the land of the achaeans.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke the<br />horses, and they made all haste to do so.</p>
    <p class=l>with grief he heard, and bade the chiefs prepare</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he mounted the chariot,</p>
    <p class=l>to join his milk-white coursers to the car;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gathered the reins in his hand, and antenor took his seat beside</p>
    <p class=l>he mounts the seat, antenor at his side;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him; they then drove through the scaean gates on to the plain.</p>
    <p class=l>the gentle steeds through scæa’s gates they guide:[120]<br />next from the car descending on the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they reached the ranks of the trojans and achaeans they left</p>
    <p class=l>amid the grecian host and trojan train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the chariot, and with measured pace advanced into the space</p>
    <p class=l>slow they proceed: the sage ulysses then</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>between the hosts.<br />agamemnon and ulysses both rose to meet them.</p>
    <p class=l>arose, and with him rose the king of men.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the attendants</p>
    <p class=l>on either side a sacred herald stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brought on the oath-offerings and mixed the wine in the</p>
    <p class=l>the wine they mix, and on each monarch’s hands</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mixing-bowls; they poured water over the hands of the chieftains,</p>
    <p class=l>pour the full urn; then draws the grecian lord</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and the son of atreus drew the dagger that hung by his sword, and</p>
    <p class=l>his cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cut wool from the lambs’ heads; this the men-servants gave about</p>
    <p class=l>from the sign’d victims crops the curling hair;[121]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among the trojan and achaean princes, and the son of atreus</p>
    <p class=l>the heralds part it, and the princes share;<br />then loudly thus before the attentive bands</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lifted up his hands in prayer.<br />“father jove,” he cried, “that</p>
    <p class=l>he calls the gods, and spreads his lifted hands:</p>

    <p class=r>if alexandrus kills menelaus, let him keep helen and all her</p>
    <p class=l>if, by paris slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wealth, while we sail home with our ships; but if menelaus kills</p>
    <p class=l>great menelaus press the fatal plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alexandrus, let the trojans give back helen and all that she has;</p>
    <p class=l>the dame and treasures let the trojan keep,<br />and greece returning plough the watery deep.<br />if by my brother’s lance the trojan bleed,<br />be his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let them moreover pay such fine to the achaeans as shall be<br />agreed upon, in testimony among those that shall be born</p>
    <p class=l>the appointed fine let ilion justly pay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hereafter.</p>
    <p class=l>and every age record the signal day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and if priam and his sons refuse such fine when</p>
    <p class=l>this if the phrygians shall refuse to yield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alexandrus has fallen, then will i stay here and fight on till i</p>
    <p class=l>arms must revenge, and mars decide the field.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have got satisfaction.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims,</p>
    <p class=l>with that the chief the tender victims slew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and laid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the</p>
    <p class=l>and in the dust their bleeding bodies threw;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>knife had reft them of their strength.</p>
    <p class=l>the vital spirit issued at the wound,<br />and left the members quivering on the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then they poured wine from</p>
    <p class=l>from the same urn they drink the mingled wine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the mixing-bowl into the cups, and prayed to the everlasting</p>
    <p class=l>and add libations to the powers divine.<br />while thus their prayers united mount the sky,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gods, saying, trojans and achaeans among one another, “jove, most</p>
    <p class=l>“hear, mighty jove!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great and glorious, and ye other everlasting gods, grant that the</p>
    <p class=l>and hear, ye gods on high!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brains of them who shall first sin against their oaths—of them</p>
    <p class=l>and may their blood, who first the league confound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and their children—may be shed upon the ground even as this wine,</p>
    <p class=l>shed like this wine, disdain the thirsty ground;<br />may all their consorts serve promiscuous lust,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and let their wives become the slaves of strangers.</p>
    <p class=l>and all their lust be scatter’d as the dust!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus they prayed, but not as yet would jove grant them their</p>
    <p class=l>thus either host their imprecations join’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>prayer.</p>
    <p class=l>which jove refused, and mingled with the wind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then priam, descendant of dardanus, spoke, saying, “hear</p>
    <p class=l>the rites now finish’d, reverend priam rose,<br />and thus express’d a heart o’ercharged with woes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me, trojans and achaeans, i will now go back to the wind-beaten</p>
    <p class=l>“ye greeks and trojans, let the chiefs engage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>city of ilius: i dare not with my own eyes witness this fight</p>
    <p class=l>but spare the weakness of my feeble age:<br />in yonder walls that object let me shun,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>between my son and menelaus, for jove and the other immortals</p>
    <p class=l>nor view the danger of so dear a son.<br />whose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alone know which shall fall.</p>
    <p class=l>heaven only knows; for heaven disposes all.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat.</p>
    <p class=l>this said, the hoary king no longer stay’d,<br />but on his car the slaughter’d victims laid:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he gathered the reins in his hand, and antenor sat beside him;</p>
    <p class=l>then seized the reins his gentle steeds to guide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the two then went back to ilius.</p>
    <p class=l>and drove to troy, antenor at his side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector and ulysses measured the</p>
    <p class=l>bold hector and ulysses now dispose</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ground, and cast lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should</p>
    <p class=l>the lists of combat, and the ground inclose:<br />next to decide, by sacred lots prepare,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>take aim first.</p>
    <p class=l>who first shall launch his pointed spear in air.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the two hosts lifted up their hands and</p>
    <p class=l>the people pray with elevated hands,<br />and words like these are heard through all the bands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>prayed saying, “father jove, that rulest from ida, most glorious</p>
    <p class=l>“immortal jove, high heaven’s superior lord,<br />on lofty ida’s holy mount adored!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in power, grant that he who first brought about this war between</p>
    <p class=l>whoe’er involved us in this dire debate,<br />o give that author of the war to fate</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>us may die, and enter the house of hades, while we others remain</p>
    <p class=l>and shades eternal!<br />let division cease,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at peace and abide by our oaths.</p>
    <p class=l>and joyful nations join in leagues of peace.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet,</p>
    <p class=l>with eyes averted hector hastes to turn</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and the lot of paris flew out first.</p>
    <p class=l>the lots of fight and shakes the brazen urn.<br />then, paris, thine leap’d forth; by fatal chance<br />ordain’d the first to whirl the weighty lance.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the others took their</p>
    <p class=l>both armies sat the combat to survey.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>several stations, each by his horses and the place where his arms</p>
    <p class=l>beside each chief his azure armour lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were lying, while alexandrus, husband of lovely helen, put on his</p>
    <p class=l>and round the lists the generous coursers neigh.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>goodly armour.</p>
    <p class=l>the beauteous warrior now arrays for fight,<br />in gilded arms magnificently bright:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first he greaved his legs with greaves of good</p>
    <p class=l>the purple cuishes clasp his thighs around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>make and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver; after this he donned</p>
    <p class=l>with flowers adorn’d, with silver buckles bound:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the cuirass of his brother lycaon, and fitted it to his own body;</p>
    <p class=l>lycaon’s corslet his fair body dress’d,<br />braced in and fitted to his softer breast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders,</p>
    <p class=l>a radiant baldric, o’er his shoulder tied,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and then his mighty shield.</p>
    <p class=l>sustain’d the sword that glitter’d at his side:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on his comely head he set his helmet,</p>
    <p class=l>his youthful face a polish’d helm o’erspread;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>well wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly</p>
    <p class=l>the waving horse-hair nodded on his head:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>above it, and he grasped a redoubtable spear that suited his</p>
    <p class=l>his figured shield, a shining orb, he takes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hands.<br />in like fashion menelaus also put on his armour.</p>
    <p class=l>and in his hand a pointed javelin shakes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode<br />fierce of aspect into the open space, and both trojans and</p>
    <p class=l>with equal speed and fired by equal charms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans were struck with awe as they beheld them.</p>
    <p class=l>the spartan hero sheathes his limbs in arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they stood</p>
    <p class=l>now round the lists the admiring armies stand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>near one another on the measured ground, brandishing their</p>
    <p class=l>with javelins fix’d, the greek and trojan band.<br />amidst the dreadful vale, the chiefs advance,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spears, and each furious against the other.</p>
    <p class=l>all pale with rage, and shake the threatening lance.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alexandrus aimed</p>
    <p class=l>the trojan first his shining javelin threw;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first, and struck the round shield of the son of atreus, but the</p>

    <p class=r>the strap of the helmet that went under his chin was choking him,</p>

    <p class=r>minerva and juno muttered their discontent as they sat side by</p>
    <p class=l>thus while he spoke, the queen of heaven, enraged,<br />and queen of war, in close consult engaged:<br />apart they sit, their deep designs employ,</p>

    <p class=r>nothing, but juno could not contain herself.</p>
    <p class=l>her sullen silence, and with fury spoke:</p>

    <p class=l>to make the breach the faithless act of troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this was what minerva was already eager to do, so down she darted</p>
    <p class=l>fired with the charge, she headlong urged her flight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from the topmost summits of olympus.</p>
    <p class=l>and shot like lightning from olympus’ height.</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>as the red comet, from saturnius sent</p>

    <p class=r>as a sign to mariners or to some great army, and a fiery train of</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>light follows in its wake.</p>
    <p class=l>and shakes the sparkles from its blazing hair:[129]<br />between both armies thus, in open sight<br />shot the bright goddess in a trail of light,</p>

    <p class=r>the trojans and achaeans were struck</p>
    <p class=l>with eyes erect the gazing hosts admire<br />the power descending, and the heavens on fire!</p>

    <p class=r>with awe as they beheld, and one would turn to his neighbour,</p>
    <p class=l>“the gods (they cried), the gods this signal sent,<br />and fate now labours with some vast event:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>case.</p>
    <p class=l>his polish’d bow with hasty rashness seized.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this bow was made from the horns of a wild ibex which he</p>
    <p class=l>’twas form’d of horn, and smooth’d with artful toil:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had killed as it was bounding from a rock; he had stalked it, and</p>

    <p class=r>sixteen palms long, and a worker in horn had made them into a</p>

    <p class=l>and beaten gold each taper point adorns.</p>

    <p class=r>when</p>
    <p class=l>this, by the greeks unseen, the warrior bends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pandarus had strung his bow he laid it carefully on the ground,<br />and his brave followers held their shields before him lest the<br />achaeans should set upon him before he had shot menelaus.</p>
    <p class=l>screen’d by the shields of his surrounding friends:</p>

    <p class=r>then he</p>
    <p class=l>there meditates the mark; and couching low,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>opened the lid of his quiver and took out a winged arrow that had</p>
    <p class=l>fits the sharp arrow to the well-strung bow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not yet been shot, fraught with the pangs of death.</p>
    <p class=l>one from a hundred feather’d deaths he chose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he laid the</p>
    <p class=l>fated to wound, and cause of future woes;</p>

    <p class=r>arrow on the string and prayed to lycian apollo, the famous</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>now with full force the yielding horn he bends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>laid the notch of the arrow on the ox-hide bowstring, and drew</p>
    <p class=l>drawn to an arch, and joins the doubling ends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>both notch and string to his breast till the arrow-head was near</p>
    <p class=l>close to his breast he strains the nerve below,</p>

    <p class=r>the bow; then when the bow was arched into a half-circle he let</p>
    <p class=l>till the barb’d points approach the circling bow;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fly, and the bow twanged, and the string sang as the arrow flew</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gladly on over the heads of the throng.</p>
    <p class=l>in that dangerous hour</p>

    <p class=l>so from her babe, when slumber seals his eye,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mother whisks a fly from off her child when it is sleeping</p>
    <p class=l>the watchful mother wafts the envenom’d fly.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sweetly; she guided it to the part where the golden buckles of</p>
    <p class=l>just where his belt with golden buckles join’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the belt that passed over his double cuirass were fastened, so</p>
    <p class=l>where linen folds the double corslet lined,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the arrow struck the belt that went tightly round him.<br />it went</p>
    <p class=l>she turn’d the shaft, which, hissing from above,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>right through this and through the cuirass of cunning</p>
    <p class=l>pass’d the broad belt, and through the corslet drove;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>workmanship; it also pierced the belt beneath it, which he wore<br />next his skin to keep out darts or arrows; it was this that<br />served him in the best stead, nevertheless the arrow went through</p>
    <p class=l>the folds it pierced, the plaited linen tore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it and grazed the top of the skin, so that blood began flowing<br />from the wound.</p>
    <p class=l>and razed the skin, and drew the purple gore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when some woman of meonia or caria strains purple dye on to a</p>
    <p class=l>as when some stately trappings are decreed</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>piece of ivory that is to be the cheek-piece of a horse, and is</p>
    <p class=l>to grace a monarch on his bounding steed,<br />a nymph in caria or mæonia bred,<br />stains the pure ivory with a lively red;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to be laid up in a treasure house—many a knight is fain to bear</p>
    <p class=l>with equal lustre various colours vie,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it, but the king keeps it as an ornament of which both horse and</p>
    <p class=l>the shining whiteness, and the tyrian dye:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>driver may be proud—even so, o menelaus, were your shapely thighs</p>
    <p class=l>so great atrides!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and your legs down to your fair ancles stained with blood.</p>
    <p class=l>show’d thy sacred blood,<br />as down thy snowy thigh distill’d the streaming flood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when king agamemnon saw the blood flowing from the wound he was</p>
    <p class=l>with horror seized, the king of men descried</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>afraid, and so was brave menelaus himself till he saw that the</p>
    <p class=l>the shaft infix’d, and saw the gushing tide:<br />nor less the spartan fear’d, before he found</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>barbs of the arrow and the thread that bound the arrow-head to<br />the shaft were still outside the wound.</p>
    <p class=l>the shining barb appear above the wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he took heart, but</p>
    <p class=l>then, with a sigh, that heaved his manly breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon heaved a deep sigh as he held menelaus’s hand in his</p>
    <p class=l>the royal brother thus his grief express’d,<br />and grasp’d his hand; while all the greeks around</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>own, and his comrades made moan in concert.</p>
    <p class=l>with answering sighs return’d the plaintive sound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“dear brother,” he</p>
    <p class=l>“oh, dear as life!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cried, “i have been the death of you in pledging this covenant</p>
    <p class=l>did i for this agree<br />the solemn truce, a fatal truce to thee!<br />wert thou exposed to all the hostile train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and letting you come forward as our champion.</p>
    <p class=l>to fight for greece, and conquer, to be slain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans have</p>
    <p class=l>the race of trojans in thy ruin join,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trampled on their oaths and have wounded you; nevertheless the</p>
    <p class=l>and faith is scorn’d by all the perjured line.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>oath, the blood of lambs, the drink-offerings and the right hands</p>
    <p class=l>not thus our vows, confirm’d with wine and gore,<br />those hands we plighted, and those oaths we swore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of fellowship in which we have put our trust shall not be vain.</p>
    <p class=l>shall all be vain: when heaven’s revenge is slow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if he that rules olympus fulfil it not here and now, he will yet</p>
    <p class=l>jove but prepares to strike the fiercer blow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fulfil it hereafter, and they shall pay dearly with their lives</p>
    <p class=l>the day shall come, that great avenging day,<br />when troy’s proud glories in the dust shall lay,<br />when priam’s powers and priam’s self shall fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and with their wives and children.</p>
    <p class=l>and one prodigious ruin swallow all.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the day will surely come when</p>
    <p class=l>i see the god, already, from the pole</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty ilius shall be laid low, with priam and priam’s people,</p>
    <p class=l>bare his red arm, and bid the thunder roll;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the son of saturn from his high throne shall overshadow them</p>
    <p class=l>i see the eternal all his fury shed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with his awful aegis in punishment of their present treachery.</p>
    <p class=l>and shake his ægis o’er their guilty head.<br />such mighty woes on perjured princes wait;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this shall surely be; but how, menelaus, shall i mourn you, if it</p>
    <p class=l>but thou, alas!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be your lot now to die?</p>
    <p class=l>deserv’st a happier fate.<br />still must i mourn the period of thy days,<br />and only mourn, without my share of praise?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i should return to argos as a by-word,</p>
    <p class=l>deprived of thee, the heartless greeks no more</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the achaeans will at once go home.</p>
    <p class=l>shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we shall leave priam and<br />the trojans the glory of still keeping helen, and the earth will</p>
    <p class=l>troy seized of helen, and our glory lost,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rot your bones as you lie here at troy with your purpose not</p>
    <p class=l>thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fulfilled.</p>
    <p class=l>while some proud trojan thus insulting cries,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then shall some braggart trojan leap upon your tomb</p>
    <p class=l>(and spurns the dust where menelaus lies,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and say, ‘ever thus may agamemnon wreak his vengeance; he brought</p>
    <p class=l>‘such are the trophies greece from ilion brings,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his army in vain; he is gone home to his own land with empty</p>
    <p class=l>and such the conquest of her king of kings!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships, and has left menelaus behind him.</p>
    <p class=l>lo his proud vessels scatter’d o’er the main,<br />and unrevenged, his mighty brother slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>’ thus will one of them</p>
    <p class=l>’<br />oh!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>say, and may the earth then swallow me.</p>
    <p class=l>ere that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,<br />o’erwhelm me, earth!<br />and hide a monarch’s shame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but menelaus reassured him and said, “take heart, and do not</p>
    <p class=l>he said: a leader’s and a brother’s fears<br />possess his soul, which thus the spartan cheers:<br />“let not thy words the warmth of greece abate;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alarm the people; the arrow has not struck me in a mortal part,</p>
    <p class=l>the feeble dart is guiltless of my fate:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for my outer belt of burnished metal first stayed it, and under</p>
    <p class=l>stiff with the rich embroider’d work around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this my cuirass and the belt of mail which the bronze-smiths made</p>
    <p class=l>my varied belt repell’d the flying wound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and agamemnon answered, “i trust, dear menelaus, that it may be</p>
    <p class=l>to whom the king: “my brother and my friend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so, but the surgeon shall examine your wound and lay herbs</p>
    <p class=l>thus, always thus, may heaven thy life defend!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon it to relieve your pain.</p>
    <p class=l>now seek some skilful hand, whose powerful art</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>may stanch the effusion, and extract the dart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then said to talthybius, “talthybius, tell machaon, son to the<br />great physician, aesculapius, to come and see menelaus</p>
    <p class=l>herald, be swift, and bid machaon bring</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>immediately.</p>
    <p class=l>his speedy succour to the spartan king;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some trojan or lycian archer has wounded him with an</p>
    <p class=l>pierced with a winged shaft (the deed of troy),</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>arrow to our dismay, and to his own great glory.</p>
    <p class=l>the grecian’s sorrow, and the dardan’s joy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>talthybius did as he was told, and went about the host trying to</p>
    <p class=l>with hasty zeal the swift talthybius flies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>find machaon.</p>
    <p class=l>through the thick files he darts his searching eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>presently he found standing amid the brave warriors</p>
    <p class=l>and finds machaon, where sublime he stands[132]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who had followed him from tricca; thereon he went up to him and</p>
    <p class=l>in arms incircled with his native bands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said, “son of aesculapius, king agamemnon says you are to come</p>
    <p class=l>then thus: “machaon, to the king repair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and see menelaus immediately.</p>
    <p class=l>his wounded brother claims thy timely care;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some trojan or lycian archer has</p>
    <p class=l>pierced by some lycian or dardanian bow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wounded him with an arrow to our dismay and to his own great</p>
    <p class=l>a grief to us, a triumph to the foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glory.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he speak, and machaon was moved to go.</p>
    <p class=l>the heavy tidings grieved the godlike man:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they passed<br />through the spreading host of the achaeans and went on till they</p>
    <p class=l>swift to his succour through the ranks he ran.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came to the place where menelaus had been wounded and was lying</p>
    <p class=l>the dauntless king yet standing firm he found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with the chieftains gathered in a circle round him.</p>
    <p class=l>and all the chiefs in deep concern around.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>machaon</p>
    <p class=l>where to the steely point the reed was join’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>passed into the middle of the ring and at once drew the arrow</p>
    <p class=l>the shaft he drew, but left the head behind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from the belt, bending its barbs back through the force with</p>
    <p class=l>straight the broad belt with gay embroidery graced,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which he pulled it out.<br />he undid the burnished belt, and beneath</p>
    <p class=l>he loosed; the corslet from his breast unbraced;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this the cuirass and the belt of mail which the bronze-smiths had<br />made; then, when he had seen the wound, he wiped away the blood</p>
    <p class=l>then suck’d the blood, and sovereign balm infused,[133]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and applied some soothing drugs which chiron had given to</p>
    <p class=l>which chiron gave, and æsculapius used.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aesculapius out of the good will he bore him.</p>
    <p class=l>while round the prince the greeks employ their care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while they were thus busy about menelaus, the trojans came</p>
    <p class=l>the trojans rush tumultuous to the war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forward against them, for they had put on their armour, and now</p>
    <p class=l>once more they glitter in refulgent arms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>renewed the fight.</p>
    <p class=l>once more the fields are fill’d with dire alarms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you would not have then found agamemnon asleep nor cowardly and</p>
    <p class=l>nor had you seen the king of men appear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>unwilling to fight, but eager rather for the fray.</p>
    <p class=l>confused, unactive, or surprised with fear;<br />but fond of glory, with severe delight,<br />his beating bosom claim’d the rising fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he left his</p>
    <p class=l>no longer with his warlike steeds he stay’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariot rich with bronze and his panting steeds in charge of</p>
    <p class=l>or press’d the car with polish’d brass inlaid</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eurymedon, son of ptolemaeus the son of peiraeus, and bade him</p>
    <p class=l>but left eurymedon the reins to guide;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hold them in readiness against the time his limbs should weary of</p>
    <p class=l>the fiery coursers snorted at his side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>going about and giving orders to so many, for he went among the<br />ranks on foot.<br />when he saw men hasting to the front he stood by</p>
    <p class=l>on foot through all the martial ranks he moves</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them and cheered them on.</p>
    <p class=l>and these encourages, and those reproves.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“argives,” said he, “slacken not one</p>
    <p class=l>“brave men!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whit in your onset; father jove will be no helper of liars; the</p>
    <p class=l>” he cries, (to such who boldly dare</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans have been the first to break their oaths and to attack</p>
    <p class=l>urge their swift steeds to face the coming war),</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>us; therefore they shall be devoured of vultures; we shall take</p>
    <p class=l>“your ancient valour on the foes approve;<br />jove is with greece, and let us trust in jove.<br />’tis not for us, but guilty troy, to dread,<br />whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their city and carry off their wives and children in our ships.</p>
    <p class=l>her sons and matrons greece shall lead in chains,<br />and her dead warriors strew the mournful plains.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined</p>
    <p class=l>thus with new ardour he the brave inspires;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to fight.</p>
    <p class=l>or thus the fearful with reproaches fires:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“argives,” he cried, “cowardly miserable creatures,</p>
    <p class=l>“shame to your country, scandal of your kind;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have you no shame to stand here like frightened fawns who, when</p>
    <p class=l>born to the fate ye well deserve to find!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they can no longer scud over the plain, huddle together, but show</p>
    <p class=l>why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>no fight?</p>
    <p class=l>prepared for flight, but doom’d to fly in vain?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you are as dazed and spiritless as deer.</p>
    <p class=l>confused and panting thus, the hunted deer<br />falls as he flies, a victim to his fear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would you wait</p>
    <p class=l>still must ye wait the foes, and still retire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>till the trojans reach the sterns of our ships as they lie on the</p>
    <p class=l>till yon tall vessels blaze with trojan fire?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shore, to see whether the son of saturn will hold his hand over</p>
    <p class=l>or trust ye, jove a valiant foe shall chase,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you to protect you?</p>
    <p class=l>to save a trembling, heartless, dastard race?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks.<br />passing</p>
    <p class=l>this said, he stalk’d with ample strides along,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through the crowd, he came presently on the cretans, arming round</p>
    <p class=l>to crete’s brave monarch and his martial throng;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus, who was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, while</p>
    <p class=l>high at their head he saw the chief appear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones was bringing up the battalions that were in the rear.</p>
    <p class=l>and bold meriones excite the rear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon was glad when he saw him, and spoke him fairly.</p>
    <p class=l>at this the king his generous joy express’d,<br />and clasp’d the warrior to his armed breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“idomeneus,” said he, “i treat you with greater distinction than</p>
    <p class=l>“divine idomeneus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i do any others of the achaeans, whether in war or in other</p>
    <p class=l>what thanks we owe</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>things, or at table.</p>
    <p class=l>to worth like thine!<br />what praise shall we bestow?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the princes are mixing my choicest</p>
    <p class=l>to thee the foremost honours are decreed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wines in the mixing-bowls, they have each of them a fixed</p>
    <p class=l>first in the fight and every graceful deed.<br />for this, in banquets, when the generous bowls<br />restore our blood, and raise the warriors’ souls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>allowance, but your cup is kept always full like my own, that you</p>
    <p class=l>though all the rest with stated rules we bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may drink whenever you are minded.</p>
    <p class=l>unmix’d, unmeasured, are thy goblets crown’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>go, therefore, into battle,</p>
    <p class=l>be still thyself, in arms a mighty name;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and show yourself the man you have been always proud to be.</p>
    <p class=l>maintain thy honours, and enlarge thy fame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus answered, “i will be a trusty comrade, as i promised</p>
    <p class=l>to whom the cretan thus his speech address’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you from the first i would be.</p>
    <p class=l>“secure of me, o king!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>urge on the other achaeans, that</p>
    <p class=l>exhort the rest.<br />fix’d to thy side, in every toil i share,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we may join battle at once, for the trojans have trampled upon</p>
    <p class=l>thy firm associate in the day of war.<br />but let the signal be this moment given;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their covenants.</p>
    <p class=l>to mix in fight is all i ask of heaven.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>death and destruction shall be theirs, seeing</p>
    <p class=l>the field shall prove how perjuries succeed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they have been the first to break their oaths and to attack us.</p>
    <p class=l>and chains or death avenge the impious deed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon the</p>
    <p class=l>charm’d with this heat, the king his course pursues,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two ajaxes arming themselves amid a host of foot soldiers.</p>
    <p class=l>and next the troops of either ajax views:<br />in one firm orb the bands were ranged around,<br />a cloud of heroes blacken’d all the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as</p>
    <p class=l>thus from the lofty promontory’s brow</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when a goat-herd from some high post watches a storm drive over</p>
    <p class=l>a swain surveys the gathering storm below;<br />slow from the main the heavy vapours rise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the deep before the west wind—black as pitch is the offing and a</p>
    <p class=l>spread in dim streams, and sail along the skies,<br />till black as night the swelling tempest shows,<br />the cloud condensing as the west-wind blows:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty whirlwind draws towards him, so that he is afraid and</p>
    <p class=l>he dreads the impending storm, and drives his flock</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drives his flock into a cave—even thus did the ranks of stalwart</p>
    <p class=l>to the close covert of an arching rock.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>youths move in a dark mass to battle under the ajaxes, horrid</p>
    <p class=l>such, and so thick, the embattled squadrons stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with shield and spear.</p>
    <p class=l>with spears erect, a moving iron wood:<br />a shady light was shot from glimmering shields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glad was king agamemnon when he saw them.</p>
    <p class=l>and their brown arms obscured the dusky fields.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“no need,” he cried, “to give orders to such leaders of the</p>
    <p class=l>“o heroes!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>argives as you are, for of your own selves you spur your men on</p>
    <p class=l>worthy such a dauntless train,<br />whose godlike virtue we but urge in vain,<br />(exclaim’d the king), who raise your eager bands</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to fight with might and main.</p>
    <p class=l>with great examples, more than loud commands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would, by father jove, minerva, and</p>
    <p class=l>ah!<br />would the gods but breathe in all the rest</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo that all were so minded as you are, for the city of priam</p>
    <p class=l>such souls as burn in your exalted breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack it.</p>
    <p class=l>soon should our arms with just success be crown’d,<br />and troy’s proud walls lie smoking on the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this he left them and went onward to nestor, the facile</p>
    <p class=l>then to the next the general bends his course;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>speaker of the pylians, who was marshalling his men and urging</p>
    <p class=l>(his heart exults, and glories in his force);<br />there reverend nestor ranks his pylian bands,<br />and with inspiring eloquence commands;<br />with strictest order sets his train in arms,<br />the chiefs advises, and the soldiers warms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them on, in company with pelagon, alastor, chromius, haemon, and</p>
    <p class=l>alastor, chromius, haemon, round him wait,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bias shepherd of his people.</p>
    <p class=l>bias the good, and pelagon the great.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he placed his knights with their<br />chariots and horses in the front rank, while the foot soldiers,</p>
    <p class=l>the horse and chariots to the front assign’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brave men and many, whom he could trust, were in the rear.</p>
    <p class=l>the foot (the strength of war) he ranged behind;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the<br />cowards he drove into the middle, that they might fight whether</p>
    <p class=l>the middle space suspected troops supply,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they would or no.</p>
    <p class=l>inclosed by both, nor left the power to fly;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he gave his orders to the knights first,<br />bidding them hold their horses well in hand, so as to avoid</p>
    <p class=l>he gives command to “curb the fiery steed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>confusion.<br />“let no man,” he said, “relying on his strength or</p>
    <p class=l>nor cause confusion, nor the ranks exceed:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horsemanship, get before the others and engage singly with the</p>
    <p class=l>before the rest let none too rashly ride;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans, nor yet let him lag behind or you will weaken your</p>
    <p class=l>no strength nor skill, but just in time, be tried:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>attack; but let each when he meets an enemy’s chariot throw his</p>
    <p class=l>the charge once made, no warrior turn the rein,<br />but fight, or fall; a firm embodied train.<br />he whom the fortune of the field shall cast<br />from forth his chariot, mount the next in haste;<br />nor seek unpractised to direct the car,<br />content with javelins to provoke the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear from his own; this be much the best; this is how the men of</p>
    <p class=l>our great forefathers held this prudent course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>old took towns and strongholds; in this wise were they minded.</p>
    <p class=l>thus ruled their ardour, thus preserved their force;<br />by laws like these immortal conquests made,<br />and earth’s proud tyrants low in ashes laid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a</p>
    <p class=l>so spoke the master of the martial art,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight, and king agamemnon was glad.</p>
    <p class=l>and touch’d with transport great atrides’ heart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“i wish,” he said to him,</p>
    <p class=l>“oh!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“that your limbs were as supple and your strength as sure as your</p>
    <p class=l>hadst thou strength to match thy brave desires,<br />and nerves to second what thy soul inspires!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>judgment is; but age, the common enemy of mankind, has laid his</p>
    <p class=l>but wasting years, that wither human race,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hand upon you; would that it had fallen upon some other, and that</p>
    <p class=l>exhaust thy spirits, and thy arms unbrace.<br />what once thou wert, oh ever mightst thou be!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you were still young.</p>
    <p class=l>and age the lot of any chief but thee.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and nestor, knight of gerene, answered, “son of atreus, i too</p>
    <p class=l>thus to the experienced prince atrides cried;<br />he shook his hoary locks, and thus replied:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would gladly be the man i was when i slew mighty ereuthalion; but</p>
    <p class=l>“well might i wish, could mortal wish renew[134]<br />that strength which once in boiling youth i knew;<br />such as i was, when ereuthalion, slain<br />beneath this arm, fell prostrate on the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the gods will not give us everything at one and the same time.</p>
    <p class=l>but heaven its gifts not all at once bestows,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i</p>
    <p class=l>these years with wisdom crowns, with action those:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was then young, and now i am old; still i can go with my knights</p>
    <p class=l>the field of combat fits the young and bold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and give them that counsel which old men have a right to give.</p>
    <p class=l>the solemn council best becomes the old:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the wielding of the spear i leave to those who are younger and</p>
    <p class=l>to you the glorious conflict i resign,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stronger than myself.</p>
    <p class=l>let sage advice, the palm of age, be mine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”<br />he said.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found menestheus,</p>
    <p class=l>with joy the monarch march’d before,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of peteos, tarrying in his place, and with him were the</p>
    <p class=l>and found menestheus on the dusty shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>athenians loud of tongue in battle.</p>
    <p class=l>with whom the firm athenian phalanx stands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>near him also tarried cunning</p>
    <p class=l>and next ulysses, with his subject bands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses, with his sturdy cephallenians round him; they had not</p>
    <p class=l>remote their forces lay, nor knew so far</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yet heard the battle-cry, for the ranks of trojans and achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>the peace infringed, nor heard the sounds of war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had only just begun to move, so they were standing still, waiting<br />for some other columns of the achaeans to attack the trojans and</p>
    <p class=l>the tumult late begun, they stood intent</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>begin the fighting.</p>
    <p class=l>to watch the motion, dubious of the event.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he saw this agamemnon rebuked them and</p>
    <p class=l>the king, who saw their squadrons yet unmoved,<br />with hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said, “son of peteos, and you other, steeped in cunning, heart of</p>
    <p class=l>“can peleus’ son forget a warrior’s part.<br />and fears ulysses, skill’d in every art?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>guile, why stand you here cowering and waiting on others?</p>
    <p class=l>why stand you distant, and the rest expect<br />to mix in combat which yourselves neglect?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you two</p>
    <p class=l>from you ’twas hoped among the first to dare</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should be of all men foremost when there is hard fighting to be</p>
    <p class=l>the shock of armies, and commence the war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>done, for you are ever foremost to accept my invitation when we</p>
    <p class=l>for this your names are call’d before the rest,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>councillors of the achaeans are holding feast.<br />you are glad</p>
    <p class=l>to share the pleasures of the genial feast:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>enough then to take your fill of roast meats and to drink wine as</p>
    <p class=l>and can you, chiefs!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>long as you please, whereas now you would not care though you saw</p>
    <p class=l>without a blush survey</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ten columns of achaeans engage the enemy in front of you.</p>
    <p class=l>whole troops before you labouring in the fray?<br />say, is it thus those honours you requite?<br />the first in banquets, but the last in fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses glared at him and answered, “son of atreus, what are you</p>
    <p class=l>ulysses heard: the hero’s warmth o’erspread<br />his cheek with blushes: and severe, he said:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>talking about?</p>
    <p class=l>“take back the unjust reproach!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>how can you say that we are slack?<br />when the</p>
    <p class=l>behold we stand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans are in full fight with the trojans, you shall see, if</p>
    <p class=l>sheathed in bright arms, and but expect command.<br />if glorious deeds afford thy soul delight,<br />behold me plunging in the thickest fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you care to do so, that the father of telemachus will join battle</p>
    <p class=l>then give thy warrior-chief a warrior’s due,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with the foremost of them.</p>
    <p class=l>who dares to act whate’er thou dar’st to view.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you are talking idly.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when agamemnon saw that ulysses was angry, he smiled pleasantly</p>
    <p class=l>struck with his generous wrath, the king replies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at him and withdrew his words.</p>
    <p class=l>“o great in action, and in council wise!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“ulysses,” said he, “noble son of</p>
    <p class=l>with ours, thy care and ardour are the same,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>laertes, excellent in all good counsel, i have neither fault to</p>
    <p class=l>nor need i to commend, nor aught to blame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>find nor orders to give you, for i know your heart is right, and</p>
    <p class=l>sage as thou art, and learn’d in human kind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that you and i are of a mind.</p>
    <p class=l>forgive the transport of a martial mind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>enough; i will make you amends for</p>
    <p class=l>haste to the fight, secure of just amends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what i have said, and if any ill has now been spoken may the gods</p>
    <p class=l>the gods that make, shall keep the worthy, friends.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bring it to nothing.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then left them and went on to others.</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and pass’d where great tydides lay,<br />his steeds and chariots wedged in firm array;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>presently he saw the son</p>
    <p class=l>(the warlike sthenelus attends his side;)[135]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of tydeus, noble diomed, standing by his chariot and horses, with</p>
    <p class=l>to whom with stern reproach the monarch cried:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sthenelus the son of capaneus beside him; whereon he began to</p>
    <p class=l>“o son of tydeus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upbraid him.</p>
    <p class=l>(he, whose strength could tame</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“son of tydeus,” he said, “why stand you cowering</p>
    <p class=l>the bounding steed, in arms a mighty name)<br />canst thou, remote, the mingling hosts descry,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>here upon the brink of battle?</p>
    <p class=l>with hands unactive, and a careless eye?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tydeus did not shrink thus, but</p>
    <p class=l>not thus thy sire the fierce encounter fear’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was ever ahead of his men when leading them on against the</p>
    <p class=l>still first in front the matchless prince appear’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foe—so, at least, say they that saw him in battle, for i never</p>
    <p class=l>what glorious toils, what wonders they recite,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>set eyes upon him myself.<br />they say that there was no man like</p>
    <p class=l>who view’d him labouring through the ranks of fight?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him.</p>
    <p class=l>i saw him once, when gathering martial powers,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he came once to mycenae, not as an enemy but as a guest, in</p>
    <p class=l>a peaceful guest, he sought mycenæ’s towers;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>company with polynices to recruit his forces, for they were<br />levying war against the strong city of thebes, and prayed our<br />people for a body of picked men to help them.<br />the men of mycenae</p>
    <p class=l>armies he ask’d, and armies had been given,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were willing to let them have one, but jove dissuaded them by</p>
    <p class=l>not we denied, but jove forbade from heaven;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>showing them unfavourable omens.</p>
    <p class=l>while dreadful comets glaring from afar,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tydeus, therefore, and polynices</p>
    <p class=l>forewarn’d the horrors of the theban war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went their way.</p>
    <p class=l>[136]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they had got as far the deep-meadowed and<br />rush-grown banks of the aesopus, the achaeans sent tydeus as</p>
    <p class=l>next, sent by greece from where asopus flows,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their envoy, and he found the cadmeans gathered in great numbers</p>
    <p class=l>a fearless envoy, he approach’d the foes;<br />thebes’ hostile walls unguarded and alone,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to a banquet in the house of eteocles.</p>
    <p class=l>dauntless he enters, and demands the throne.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stranger though he was, he<br />knew no fear on finding himself single-handed among so many, but</p>
    <p class=l>the tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>challenged them to contests of all kinds, and in each one of them</p>
    <p class=l>and dared to combat all those chiefs around:<br />dared, and subdued before their haughty lord;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was at once victorious, so mightily did minerva help him.</p>
    <p class=l>for pallas strung his arm and edged his sword.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>stung with the shame, within the winding way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cadmeans were incensed at his success, and set a force of fifty</p>
    <p class=l>to bar his passage fifty warriors lay;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>youths with two captains—the godlike hero maeon, son of haemon,</p>
    <p class=l>two heroes led the secret squadron on,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and polyphontes, son of autophonus—at their head, to lie in wait</p>
    <p class=l>mason the fierce, and hardy lycophon;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for him on his return journey; but tydeus slew every man of them,</p>
    <p class=l>those fifty slaughter’d in the gloomy vale.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>save only maeon, whom he let go in obedience to heaven’s omens.</p>
    <p class=l>he spared but one to bear the dreadful tale,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>such was tydeus of aetolia.</p>
    <p class=l>such tydeus was, and such his martial fire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his son can talk more glibly, but he</p>
    <p class=l>gods!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cannot fight as his father did.</p>
    <p class=l>how the son degenerates from the sire!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of</p>
    <p class=l>no words the godlike diomed return’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon; but the son of capaneus took up his words and said,</p>
    <p class=l>but heard respectful, and in secret burn’d:<br />not so fierce capaneus’ undaunted son;<br />stern as his sire, the boaster thus begun:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“son of atreus, tell no lies, for you can speak truth if you</p>
    <p class=l>“what needs, o monarch!<br />this invidious praise,<br />ourselves to lessen, while our sire you raise?<br />dare to be just, atrides!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will.</p>
    <p class=l>and confess</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we boast ourselves as even better men than our fathers; we</p>
    <p class=l>our value equal, though our fury less.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>took seven-gated thebes, though the wall was stronger and our men</p>
    <p class=l>with fewer troops we storm’d the theban wall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were fewer in number, for we trusted in the omens of the gods and</p>
    <p class=l>and happier saw the sevenfold city fall,[137]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the help of jove, whereas they perished through their own</p>
    <p class=l>in impious acts the guilty father died;<br />the sons subdued, for heaven was on their side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sheer folly; hold not, then, our fathers in like honour with us.</p>
    <p class=l>far more than heirs of all our parents’ fame,<br />our glories darken their diminish’d name.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed looked sternly at him and said, “hold your peace, my<br />friend, as i bid you.</p>
    <p class=l>to him tydides thus: “my friend, forbear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it is not amiss that agamemnon should urge</p>
    <p class=l>suppress thy passion, and the king revere:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans forward, for the glory will be his if we take the</p>
    <p class=l>his high concern may well excuse this rage,<br />whose cause we follow, and whose war we wage:<br />his the first praise, were ilion’s towers o’erthrown,</p>

    <p class=r>city, and his the shame if we are vanquished.</p>
    <p class=l>and, if we fail, the chief disgrace his own.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore let us</p>
    <p class=l>let him the greeks to hardy toils excite,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>acquit ourselves with valour.</p>
    <p class=l>’tis ours to labour in the glorious fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his armour rang so</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, and ardent, on the trembling ground<br />sprung from his car: his ringing arms resound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fiercely about his body that even a brave man might well have</p>
    <p class=l>dire was the clang, and dreadful from afar,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>been scared to hear it.</p>
    <p class=l>of arm’d tydides rushing to the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when some mighty wave that thunders on the beach when the west<br />wind has lashed it into fury—it has reared its head afar and now</p>
    <p class=l>as when the winds, ascending by degrees,[138]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>comes crashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest high</p>
    <p class=l>first move the whitening surface of the seas,<br />the billows float in order to the shore,<br />the wave behind rolls on the wave before;<br />till, with the growing storm, the deeps arise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over the jagged rocks and spews its salt foam in all</p>
    <p class=l>foam o’er the rocks, and thunder to the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>directions—even so did the serried phalanxes of the danaans march</p>
    <p class=l>so to the fight the thick battalions throng,<br />shields urged on shields, and men drove men along</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>steadfastly to battle.</p>
    <p class=l>sedate and silent move the numerous bands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the chiefs gave orders each to his own</p>
    <p class=l>no sound, no whisper, but the chief’s commands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>people, but the men said never a word; no man would think it, for</p>
    <p class=l>those only heard; with awe the rest obey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>huge as the host was, it seemed as though there was not a tongue</p>
    <p class=l>as if some god had snatch’d their voice away.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among them, so silent were they in their obedience; and as they</p>
    <p class=l>not so the trojans; from their host ascends</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>marched the armour about their bodies glistened in the sun.</p>
    <p class=l>a general shout that all the region rends.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but<br />the clamour of the trojan ranks was as that of many thousand ewes</p>
    <p class=l>as when the fleecy flocks unnumber’d stand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that stand waiting to be milked in the yards of some rich</p>
    <p class=l>in wealthy folds, and wait the milker’s hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flock-master, and bleat incessantly in answer to the bleating of</p>
    <p class=l>the hollow vales incessant bleating fills,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their lambs; for they had not one speech nor language, but their</p>
    <p class=l>the lambs reply from all the neighbouring hills:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tongues were diverse, and they came from many different places.</p>
    <p class=l>such clamours rose from various nations round,<br />mix’d was the murmur, and confused the sound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these were inspired of mars, but the others by minerva—and with</p>
    <p class=l>each host now joins, and each a god inspires,<br />these mars incites, and those minerva fires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them came panic, rout, and strife whose fury never tires, sister</p>
    <p class=l>pale flight around, and dreadful terror reign;<br />and discord raging bathes the purple plain;<br />discord!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and friend of murderous mars, who, from being at first but low in</p>
    <p class=l>dire sister of the slaughtering power,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stature, grows till she uprears her head to heaven, though her</p>
    <p class=l>small at her birth, but rising every hour,<br />while scarce the skies her horrid head can bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>feet are still on earth.</p>
    <p class=l>she stalks on earth, and shakes the world around;[139]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she it was that went about among them</p>
    <p class=l>the nations bleed, where’er her steps she turns,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and flung down discord to the waxing of sorrow with even hand</p>
    <p class=l>the groan still deepens, and the combat burns.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>between them.</p>
    <p class=l>now shield with shield, with helmet helmet closed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they were got together in one place shield clashed with<br />shield and spear with spear in the rage of battle.</p>
    <p class=l>to armour armour, lance to lance opposed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the bossed</p>
    <p class=l>host against host with shadowy squadrons drew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shields beat one upon another, and there was a tramp as of a</p>
    <p class=l>the sounding darts in iron tempests flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great multitude—death-cry and shout of triumph of slain and</p>
    <p class=l>victors and vanquish’d join’d promiscuous cries,<br />and shrilling shouts and dying groans arise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>slayers, and the earth ran red with blood.</p>
    <p class=l>with streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,<br />and slaughter’d heroes swell the dreadful tide.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as torrents swollen</p>
    <p class=l>as torrents roll, increased by numerous rills,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with rain course madly down their deep channels till the angry</p>
    <p class=l>with rage impetuous, down their echoing hills</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>floods meet in some gorge, and the shepherd on the hillside hears</p>
    <p class=l>rush to the vales, and pour’d along the plain,<br />roar through a thousand channels to the main:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their roaring from afar—even such was the toil and uproar of the</p>
    <p class=l>the distant shepherd trembling hears the sound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hosts as they joined in battle.</p>
    <p class=l>so mix both hosts, and so their cries rebound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first antilochus slew an armed warrior of the trojans, echepolus,</p>
    <p class=l>the bold antilochus the slaughter led,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of thalysius, fighting in the foremost ranks.</p>
    <p class=l>the first who struck a valiant trojan dead:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he struck at</p>
    <p class=l>at great echepolus the lance arrives,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the projecting part of his helmet and drove the spear into his</p>
    <p class=l>razed his high crest, and through his helmet drives;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brow; the point of bronze pierced the bone, and darkness veiled</p>
    <p class=l>warm’d in the brain the brazen weapon lies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his eyes; headlong as a tower he fell amid the press of the</p>
    <p class=l>and shades eternal settle o’er his eyes.<br />so sinks a tower, that long assaults had stood</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight, and as he dropped king elephenor, son of chalcodon and</p>
    <p class=l>of force and fire, its walls besmear’d with blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>captain of the proud abantes began dragging him out of reach of</p>
    <p class=l>him, the bold leader of the abantian throng,[140]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the darts that were falling around him, in haste to strip him of</p>
    <p class=l>seized to despoil, and dragg’d the corpse along:<br />but while he strove to tug the inserted dart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his armour.</p>
    <p class=l>agenor’s javelin reach’d the hero’s heart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but his purpose was not for long; agenor saw him<br />haling the body away, and smote him in the side with his<br />bronze-shod spear—for as he stooped his side was left unprotected</p>
    <p class=l>his flank, unguarded by his ample shield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by his shield—and thus he perished.</p>
    <p class=l>admits the lance: he falls, and spurns the field;<br />the nerves, unbraced, support his limbs no more;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then the fight between</p>
    <p class=l>the soul comes floating in a tide of gore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans and achaeans grew furious over his body, and they flew</p>
    <p class=l>trojans and greeks now gather round the slain;<br />the war renews, the warriors bleed again:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon each other like wolves, man and man crushing one upon the</p>
    <p class=l>as o’er their prey rapacious wolves engage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>other.</p>
    <p class=l>man dies on man, and all is blood and rage.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forthwith ajax, son of telamon, slew the fair youth simoeisius,</p>
    <p class=l>in blooming youth fair simoisius fell,<br />sent by great ajax to the shades of hell;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of anthemion, whom his mother bore by the banks of the</p>
    <p class=l>fair simoisius, whom his mother bore</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>simois, as she was coming down from mt.</p>
    <p class=l>amid the flocks on silver simois’ shore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ida, where she had been</p>
    <p class=l>the nymph descending from the hills of ide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with her parents to see their flocks.</p>
    <p class=l>to seek her parents on his flowery side,<br />brought forth the babe, their common care and joy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore he was named</p>
    <p class=l>and thence from simois named the lovely boy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>simoeisius, but he did not live to pay his parents for his</p>
    <p class=l>short was his date!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rearing, for he was cut off untimely by the spear of mighty ajax,</p>
    <p class=l>by dreadful ajax slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who struck him in the breast by the right nipple as he was coming<br />on among the foremost fighters; the spear went right through his</p>
    <p class=l>he falls, and renders all their cares in vain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shoulder, and he fell as a poplar that has grown straight and</p>
    <p class=l>so falls a poplar, that in watery ground</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tall in a meadow by some mere, and its top is thick with</p>
    <p class=l>raised high the head, with stately branches crown’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>branches.</p>
    <p class=l>(fell’d by some artist with his shining steel,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then the wheelwright lays his axe to its roots that he</p>
    <p class=l>to shape the circle of the bending wheel,)<br />cut down it lies, tall, smooth, and largely spread,<br />with all its beauteous honours on its head</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may fashion a felloe for the wheel of some goodly chariot, and it</p>
    <p class=l>there, left a subject to the wind and rain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lies seasoning by the waterside.</p>
    <p class=l>and scorch’d by suns, it withers on the plain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in such wise did ajax fell to</p>
    <p class=l>thus pierced by ajax, simoisius lies</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>earth simoeisius, son of anthemion.</p>
    <p class=l>stretch’d on the shore, and thus neglected dies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon antiphus of the</p>
    <p class=l>at ajax, antiphus his javelin threw;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gleaming corslet, son of priam, hurled a spear at ajax from amid</p>
    <p class=l>the pointed lance with erring fury flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the crowd and missed him, but he hit leucus, the brave comrade of</p>
    <p class=l>and leucus, loved by wise ulysses, slew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses, in the groin, as he was dragging the body of simoeisius<br />over to the other side; so he fell upon the body and loosed his</p>
    <p class=l>he drops the corpse of simoisius slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hold upon it.</p>
    <p class=l>and sinks a breathless carcase on the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses was furious when he saw leucus slain, and</p>
    <p class=l>this saw ulysses, and with grief enraged,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strode in full armour through the front ranks till he was quite</p>
    <p class=l>strode where the foremost of the foes engaged;<br />arm’d with his spear, he meditates the wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>close; then he glared round about him and took aim, and the</p>
    <p class=l>in act to throw; but cautious look’d around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans fell back as he did so.</p>
    <p class=l>struck at his sight the trojans backward drew,<br />and trembling heard the javelin as it flew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his dart was not sped in vain,</p>
    <p class=l>a chief stood nigh, who from abydos came,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for it struck democoon, the bastard son of priam, who had come to<br />him from abydos, where he had charge of his father’s mares.</p>
    <p class=l>old priam’s son, democoon was his name.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses, infuriated by the death of his comrade, hit him with his</p>
    <p class=l>the weapon entered close above his ear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear on one temple, and the bronze point came through on the</p>
    <p class=l>cold through his temples glides the whizzing spear;[141]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>other side of his forehead.</p>
    <p class=l>with piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon darkness veiled his eyes, and</p>
    <p class=l>his eye-balls darken with the shades of death;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the</p>
    <p class=l>ponderous he falls; his clanging arms resound,<br />and his broad buckler rings against the ground.<br />seized with affright the boldest foes appear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ground.</p>
    <p class=l>e’en godlike hector seems himself to fear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector, and they that were in front, then gave round</p>
    <p class=l>slow he gave way, the rest tumultuous fled;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while the argives raised a shout and drew off the dead, pressing</p>
    <p class=l>the greeks with shouts press on, and spoil the dead:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>further forward as they did so.<br />but apollo looked down from</p>
    <p class=l>but phœbus now from ilion’s towering height</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pergamus and called aloud to the trojans, for he was displeased.</p>
    <p class=l>shines forth reveal’d, and animates the fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“trojans,” he cried, “rush on the foe, and do not let yourselves</p>
    <p class=l>“trojans, be bold, and force with force oppose;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be thus beaten by the argives.</p>
    <p class=l>your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their skins are not stone nor iron</p>
    <p class=l>nor are their bodies rocks, nor ribb’d with steel;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that when you hit them you do them no harm.</p>
    <p class=l>your weapons enter, and your strokes they feel.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moreover, achilles, the</p>
    <p class=l>have ye forgot what seem’d your dread before?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of lovely thetis, is not fighting, but is nursing his anger</p>
    <p class=l>the great, the fierce achilles fights no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at the ships.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, while</p>
    <p class=l>apollo thus from ilion’s lofty towers,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove’s redoubtable daughter, the trito-born, went about among the</p>
    <p class=l>array’d in terrors, roused the trojan powers:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>host of the achaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld</p>
    <p class=l>while war’s fierce goddess fires the grecian foe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them slackening.</p>
    <p class=l>and shouts and thunders in the fields below.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then fate fell upon diores, son of amarynceus, for he was struck</p>
    <p class=l>then great diores fell, by doom divine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by a jagged stone near the ancle of his right leg.</p>
    <p class=l>in vain his valour and illustrious line.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he that hurled</p>
    <p class=l>a broken rock the force of pyrus threw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it was peirous, son of imbrasus, captain of the thracians, who</p>
    <p class=l>(who from cold ænus led the thracian crew,)[142]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had come from aenus; the bones and both the tendons were crushed</p>
    <p class=l>full on his ankle dropp’d the ponderous stone,<br />burst the strong nerves, and crash’d the solid bone.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by the pitiless stone.</p>
    <p class=l>supine he tumbles on the crimson sands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he fell to the ground on his back, and in</p>
    <p class=l>before his helpless friends, and native bands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his death-throes stretched out his hands towards his comrades.</p>
    <p class=l>and spreads for aid his unavailing hands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but peirous, who had wounded him, sprang on him and thrust a</p>
    <p class=l>the foe rush’d furious as he pants for breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear into his belly, so that his bowels came gushing out upon</p>
    <p class=l>and through his navel drove the pointed death:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ground, and darkness veiled his eyes.</p>
    <p class=l>his gushing entrails smoked upon the ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he was leaving the</p>
    <p class=l>and the warm life came issuing from the wound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body, thoas of aetolia struck him in the chest near the nipple,</p>
    <p class=l>his lance bold thoas at the conqueror sent,<br />deep in his breast above the pap it went,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and the point fixed itself in his lungs.</p>
    <p class=l>amid the lungs was fix’d the winged wood,<br />and quivering in his heaving bosom stood:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thoas came close up to</p>
    <p class=l>till from the dying chief, approaching near,<br />the ætolian warrior tugg’d his weighty spear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him, pulled the spear out of his chest, and then drawing his</p>
    <p class=l>then sudden waved his flaming falchion round,<br />and gash’d his belly with a ghastly wound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sword, smote him in the middle of the belly so that he died; but</p>
    <p class=l>the corpse now breathless on the bloody plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he did not strip him of his armour, for his thracian comrades,</p>
    <p class=l>to spoil his arms the victor strove in vain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men who wear their hair in a tuft at the top of their heads,</p>
    <p class=l>the thracian bands against the victor press’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stood round the body and kept him off with their long spears for</p>
    <p class=l>a grove of lances glitter’d at his breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all his great stature and valour; so he was driven back.</p>
    <p class=l>stern thoas, glaring with revengeful eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus the</p>
    <p class=l>in sullen fury slowly quits the prize.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two corpses lay stretched on earth near to one another, the one</p>
    <p class=l>thus fell two heroes; one the pride of thrace,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>captain of the thracians and the other of the epeans; and many</p>
    <p class=l>and one the leader of the epeian race;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>another fell round them.</p>
    <p class=l>death’s sable shade at once o’ercast their eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now no man would have made light of the fighting if he could</p>
    <p class=l>in dust the vanquish’d and the victor lies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have gone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with minerva</p>
    <p class=l>with copious slaughter all the fields are red,<br />and heap’d with growing mountains of the dead.<br />had some brave chief this martial scene beheld,<br />by pallas guarded through the dreadful field;<br />might darts be bid to turn their points away,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>leading him by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of</p>
    <p class=l>and swords around him innocently play;<br />the war’s whole art with wonder had he seen,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spears and arrows.</p>
    <p class=l>and counted heroes where he counted men.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for many trojans and achaeans on that day lay</p>
    <p class=l>so fought each host, with thirst of glory fired,<br />and crowds on crowds triumphantly expired.</p>

    <p class=l>where the fight burns, and where the thickest rage.<br />the sons of dares first the combat sought,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now there was a certain rich and honourable man among the</p>
    <p class=l>a wealthy priest, but rich without a fault;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans, priest of vulcan, and his name was dares.<br />he had two</p>
    <p class=l>in vulcan’s fane the father’s days were led,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sons, phegeus and idaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of</p>
    <p class=l>the sons to toils of glorious battle bred;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>war.</p>
    <p class=l>these singled from their troops the fight maintain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these two came forward from the main body of trojans, and<br />set upon diomed, he being on foot, while they fought from their<br />chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>these, from their steeds, tydides on the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they were close up to one another, phegeus took aim</p>
    <p class=l>fierce for renown the brother-chiefs draw near,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first, but his spear went over diomed’s left shoulder without</p>
    <p class=l>and first bold phegeus cast his sounding spear,<br />which o’er the warrior’s shoulder took its course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hitting him.</p>
    <p class=l>and spent in empty air its erring force.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed then threw, and his spear sped not in vain,</p>
    <p class=l>not so, tydides, flew thy lance in vain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for it hit phegeus on the breast near the nipple, and he fell</p>
    <p class=l>but pierced his breast, and stretch’d him on the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from his chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>seized with unusual fear, idæus fled,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idaeus did not dare to bestride his brother’s<br />body, but sprang from the chariot and took to flight, or he would</p>
    <p class=l>left the rich chariot, and his brother dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have shared his brother’s fate; whereon vulcan saved him by</p>
    <p class=l>and had not vulcan lent celestial aid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wrapping him in a cloud of darkness, that his old father might</p>
    <p class=l>he too had sunk to death’s eternal shade;<br />but in a smoky cloud the god of fire</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not be utterly overwhelmed with grief; but the son of tydeus</p>
    <p class=l>preserved the son, in pity to the sire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drove off with the horses, and bade his followers take them to</p>
    <p class=l>the steeds and chariot, to the navy led,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>increased the spoils of gallant diomed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans were scared when they saw the two sons of</p>
    <p class=l>struck with amaze and shame, the trojan crew,<br />or slain, or fled, the sons of dares view;<br />when by the blood-stain’d hand minerva press’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dares, one of them in fright and the other lying dead by his</p>
    <p class=l>the god of battles, and this speech address’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>“stern power of war!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva, therefore, took mars by the hand and said,</p>
    <p class=l>by whom the mighty fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“mars, mars, bane of men, blood-stained stormer of cities, may we</p>
    <p class=l>who bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not now leave the trojans and achaeans to fight it out, and see</p>
    <p class=l>let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to which of the two jove will vouchsafe the victory?</p>
    <p class=l>and whose the conquest, mighty jove decide:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us go</p>
    <p class=l>while we from interdicted fields retire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>away, and thus avoid his anger.</p>
    <p class=l>nor tempt the wrath of heaven’s avenging sire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so saying, she drew mars out of the battle, and set him down upon</p>
    <p class=l>her words allay the impetuous warrior’s heat,<br />the god of arms and martial maid retreat;<br />removed from fight, on xanthus’ flowery bounds</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the steep banks of the scamander.</p>
    <p class=l>they sat, and listen’d to the dying sounds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon this the danaans drove the</p>
    <p class=l>meantime, the greeks the trojan race pursue,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans back, and each one of their chieftains killed his man.</p>
    <p class=l>and some bold chieftain every leader slew:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first king agamemnon flung mighty odius, captain of the halizoni,</p>
    <p class=l>first odius falls, and bites the bloody sand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from his chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>his death ennobled by atrides’ hand:<br />as he to flight his wheeling car address’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the spear of agamemnon caught him on the broad</p>
    <p class=l>the speedy javelin drove from back to breast.<br />in dust the mighty halizonian lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of his back, just as he was turning in flight; it struck him</p>
    <p class=l>his arms resound, the spirit wings its way.<br />thy fate was next, o phæstus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>between the shoulders and went right through his chest, and his</p>
    <p class=l>doom’d to feel</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>the great idomeneus’ protended steel;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then idomeneus killed phaesus, son of borus the meonian, who had</p>
    <p class=l>whom borus sent (his son and only joy)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come from varne.</p>
    <p class=l>from fruitful tarne to the fields of troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty idomeneus speared him on the right</p>
    <p class=l>the cretan javelin reach’d him from afar,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shoulder as he was mounting his chariot, and the darkness of</p>
    <p class=l>and pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>death enshrouded him as he fell heavily from the car.</p>
    <p class=l>back from the car he tumbles to the ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the squires of idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while</p>
    <p class=l>and everlasting shades his eyes surround.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus, son of atreus, killed scamandrius the son of strophius,</p>
    <p class=l>then died scamandrius, expert in the chase,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a mighty huntsman and keen lover of the chase.</p>
    <p class=l>in woods and wilds to wound the savage race;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diana herself had</p>
    <p class=l>diana taught him all her sylvan arts,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>taught him how to kill every kind of wild creature that is bred</p>
    <p class=l>to bend the bow, and aim unerring darts:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in mountain forests, but neither she nor his famed skill in</p>
    <p class=l>but vainly here diana’s arts he tries,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>archery could now save him, for the spear of menelaus struck him</p>
    <p class=l>the fatal lance arrests him as he flies;<br />from menelaus’ arm the weapon sent,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the back as he was flying; it struck him between the shoulders<br />and went right through his chest, so that he fell headlong and</p>
    <p class=l>through his broad back and heaving bosom went:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his armour rang rattling round him.</p>
    <p class=l>down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,<br />his brazen armour rings against the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones then killed phereclus the son of tecton, who was the son</p>
    <p class=l>next artful phereclus untimely fell;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of hermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning</p>
    <p class=l>bold merion sent him to the realms of hell.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>workmanship, for pallas minerva had dearly loved him.</p>
    <p class=l>thy father’s skill, o phereclus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he it was</p>
    <p class=l>was thine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that made the ships for alexandrus, which were the beginning of</p>
    <p class=l>the graceful fabric and the fair design;<br />for loved by pallas, pallas did impart<br />to him the shipwright’s and the builder’s art.<br />beneath his hand the fleet of paris rose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all mischief, and brought evil alike both on the trojans and on</p>
    <p class=l>the fatal cause of all his country’s woes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alexandrus himself; for he heeded not the decrees of heaven.</p>
    <p class=l>but he, the mystic will of heaven unknown,<br />nor saw his country’s peril, nor his own.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones overtook him as he was flying, and struck him on the</p>
    <p class=l>the hapless artist, while confused he fled,<br />the spear of merion mingled with the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>right buttock.</p>
    <p class=l>through his right hip, with forceful fury cast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the point of the spear went through the bone into</p>
    <p class=l>between the bladder and the bone it pass’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the bladder, and death came upon him as he cried aloud and fell</p>
    <p class=l>prone on his knees he falls with fruitless cries,<br />and death in lasting slumber seals his eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forward on his knees.</p>
    <p class=l>from meges’ force the swift pedaeus fled,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meges, moreover, slew pedaeus, son of antenor, who, though he was</p>
    <p class=l>antenor’s offspring from a foreign bed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a bastard, had been brought up by theano as one of her own</p>
    <p class=l>whose generous spouse, theanor, heavenly fair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>children, for the love she bore her husband.</p>
    <p class=l>nursed the young stranger with a mother’s care.<br />how vain those cares!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of phyleus</p>
    <p class=l>when meges in the rear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>got close up to him and drove a spear into the nape of his neck:</p>
    <p class=l>full in his nape infix’d the fatal spear;<br />swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it went under his tongue all among his teeth, so he bit the cold</p>
    <p class=l>and the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bronze, and fell dead in the dust.<br />and eurypylus, son of euaemon, killed hypsenor, the son of noble</p>
    <p class=l>then died hypsenor, generous and divine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dolopion, who had been made priest of the river scamander, and</p>
    <p class=l>sprung from the brave dolopion’s mighty line,<br />who near adored scamander made abode,<br />priest of the stream, and honoured as a god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was honoured among the people as though he were a god.</p>
    <p class=l>on him, amidst the flying numbers found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eurypylus</p>
    <p class=l>eurypylus inflicts a deadly wound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gave him chase as he was flying before him, smote him with his</p>
    <p class=l>on his broad shoulders fell the forceful brand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sword upon the arm, and lopped his strong hand from off it.</p>
    <p class=l>thence glancing downwards, lopp’d his holy hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>which stain’d with sacred blood the blushing sand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bloody hand fell to the ground, and the shades of death, with</p>
    <p class=l>down sunk the priest: the purple hand of death</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fate that no man can withstand, came over his eyes.</p>
    <p class=l>closed his dim eye, and fate suppress’d his breath.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus furiously did the battle rage between them.</p>
    <p class=l>thus toil’d the chiefs, in different parts engaged.<br />in every quarter fierce tydides raged;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as for the son</p>
    <p class=l>amid the greek, amid the trojan train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of tydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the</p>
    <p class=l>rapt through the ranks he thunders o’er the plain;<br />now here, now there, he darts from place to place,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans or the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>pours on the rear, or lightens in their face.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he rushed across the plain like a winter</p>
    <p class=l>thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>torrent that has burst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no</p>
    <p class=l>deluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along,<br />through ruin’d moles the rushing wave resounds,<br />o’erwhelm’s the bridge, and bursts the lofty bounds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>walls of fruitful vineyards can embank it when it is swollen with</p>
    <p class=l>the yellow harvests of the ripen’d year,<br />and flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rain from heaven, but in a moment it comes tearing onward, and</p>
    <p class=l>[144]<br />while jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lays many a field waste that many a strong man’s hand has</p>
    <p class=l>and all the labours of mankind are vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>reclaimed—even so were the dense phalanxes of the trojans driven</p>
    <p class=l>so raged tydides, boundless in his ire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in rout by the son of tydeus, and many though they were, they</p>
    <p class=l>drove armies back, and made all troy retire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dared not abide his onslaught.</p>
    <p class=l>with grief the leader of the lycian band</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now when the son of lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving</p>
    <p class=l>saw the wide waste of his destructive hand:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the</p>
    <p class=l>his bended bow against the chief he drew;<br />swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>front part of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right</p>
    <p class=l>whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through the metal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was</p>
    <p class=l>deep in his shoulder pierced, and drank the gore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>covered with blood.</p>
    <p class=l>the rushing stream his brazen armour dyed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this the son of lycaon shouted in triumph,</p>
    <p class=l>while the proud archer thus exulting cried:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“knights trojans, come on; the bravest of the achaeans is</p>
    <p class=l>“hither, ye trojans, hither drive your steeds!<br />lo!<br />by our hand the bravest grecian bleeds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wounded, and he will not hold out much longer if king apollo was</p>
    <p class=l>not long the deathful dart he can sustain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>indeed with me when i sped from lycia hither.</p>
    <p class=l>or phœbus urged me to these fields in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed diomed, who</p>
    <p class=l>so spoke he, boastful: but the winged dart<br />stopp’d short of life, and mock’d the shooter’s art.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>withdrew and made for the chariot and horses of sthenelus, the</p>
    <p class=l>the wounded chief, behind his car retired,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of capaneus.</p>
    <p class=l>the helping hand of sthenelus required;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“dear son of capaneus,” said he, “come down from</p>
    <p class=l>swift from his seat he leap’d upon the ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your chariot, and draw the arrow out of my shoulder.</p>
    <p class=l>and tugg’d the weapon from the gushing wound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>when thus the king his guardian power address’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the</p>
    <p class=l>the purple current wandering o’er his vest:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wound, whereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that</p>
    <p class=l>“o progeny of jove!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had been made in his shirt.</p>
    <p class=l>unconquer’d maid!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then diomed prayed, saying, “hear me,<br />daughter of aegis-bearing jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my</p>
    <p class=l>if e’er my godlike sire deserved thy aid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father well and stood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like</p>
    <p class=l>if e’er i felt thee in the fighting field;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now by me; grant me to come within a spear’s throw of that man</p>
    <p class=l>now, goddess, now, thy sacred succour yield.<br />o give my lance to reach the trojan knight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and kill him.</p>
    <p class=l>whose arrow wounds the chief thou guard’st in fight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he has been too quick for me and has wounded me;</p>
    <p class=l>and lay the boaster grovelling on the shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now he is boasting that i shall not see the light of the sun</p>
    <p class=l>that vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>much longer.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus he prayed, and pallas minerva heard him; she made his limbs</p>
    <p class=l>thus pray’d tydides, and minerva heard,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>supple and quickened his hands and his feet.</p>
    <p class=l>his nerves confirm’d, his languid spirits cheer’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then she went up</p>
    <p class=l>he feels each limb with wonted vigour light;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>close to him and said, “fear not, diomed, to do battle with the</p>
    <p class=l>his beating bosom claim’d the promised fight.<br />“be bold, (she cried), in every combat shine,<br />war be thy province, thy protection mine;<br />rush to the fight, and every foe control;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans, for i have set in your heart the spirit of your knightly</p>
    <p class=l>wake each paternal virtue in thy soul:<br />strength swells thy boiling breast, infused by me,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father tydeus.</p>
    <p class=l>and all thy godlike father breathes in thee;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moreover, i have withdrawn the veil from your</p>
    <p class=l>yet more, from mortal mists i purge thy eyes,[145]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eyes, that you know gods and men apart.</p>
    <p class=l>and set to view the warring deities.<br />these see thou shun, through all the embattled plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if, then, any other god</p>
    <p class=l>nor rashly strive where human force is vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>comes here and offers you battle, do not fight him; but should</p>
    <p class=l>if venus mingle in the martial band,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove’s daughter venus come, strike her with your spear and wound</p>
    <p class=l>her shalt thou wound: so pallas gives command.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when she had said this minerva went away, and the son of tydeus</p>
    <p class=l>with that, the blue-eyed virgin wing’d her flight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>again took his place among the foremost fighters, three times</p>
    <p class=l>the hero rush’d impetuous to the fight;<br />with tenfold ardour now invades the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>more fierce even than he had been before.</p>
    <p class=l>wild with delay, and more enraged by pain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was like a lion that<br />some mountain shepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is</p>
    <p class=l>as on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>springing over the wall of a sheep-yard to attack the sheep.<br />the</p>
    <p class=l>amidst the field a brindled lion falls;</p>

    <p class=r>shepherd has roused the brute to fury but cannot defend his</p>
    <p class=l>if chance some shepherd with a distant dart</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flock, so he takes shelter under cover of the buildings, while</p>
    <p class=l>the savage wound, he rouses at the smart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sheep, panic-stricken on being deserted, are smothered in</p>
    <p class=l>he foams, he roars; the shepherd dares not stay,<br />but trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heaps one on top of the other, and the angry lion leaps out over</p>
    <p class=l>heaps fall on heaps; he bathes with blood the ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sheep-yard wall.</p>
    <p class=l>then leaps victorious o’er the lofty mound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even thus did diomed go furiously about</p>
    <p class=l>not with less fury stern tydides flew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>and two brave leaders at an instant slew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he killed astynous, and hypeiron shepherd of his people, the one</p>
    <p class=l>astynous breathless fell, and by his side,<br />his people’s pastor, good hypenor, died;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with a thrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple,<br />the other with a sword-cut on the collar-bone, that severed his</p>
    <p class=l>astynous’ breast the deadly lance receives,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shoulder from his neck and back.</p>
    <p class=l>hypenor’s shoulder his broad falchion cleaves.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he let both of them lie, and</p>
    <p class=l>those slain he left, and sprung with noble rage</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went in pursuit of abas and polyidus, sons of the old reader of</p>
    <p class=l>abas and polyidus to engage;<br />sons of eurydamus, who, wise and old,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dreams eurydamas: they never came back for him to read them any</p>
    <p class=l>could fate foresee, and mystic dreams unfold;<br />the youths return’d not from the doubtful plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>more dreams, for mighty diomed made an end of them.</p>
    <p class=l>and the sad father tried his arts in vain;<br />no mystic dream could make their fates appear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then gave</p>
    <p class=l>though now determined by tydides’ spear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chase to xanthus and thoon, the two sons of phaenops, both of</p>
    <p class=l>young xanthus next, and thoon felt his rage;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them very dear to him, for he was now worn out with age, and</p>
    <p class=l>the joy and hope of phaenops’ feeble age:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>begat no more sons to inherit his possessions.<br />but diomed took</p>
    <p class=l>vast was his wealth, and these the only heirs</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>both their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly, for he</p>
    <p class=l>of all his labours and a life of cares.<br />cold death o’ertakes them in their blooming years,<br />and leaves the father unavailing tears:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen</p>
    <p class=l>to strangers now descends his heapy store,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>divided his wealth among themselves.</p>
    <p class=l>the race forgotten, and the name no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he came upon two sons of priam, echemmon and chromius, as</p>
    <p class=l>two sons of priam in one chariot ride,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were both in one chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>glittering in arms, and combat side by side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he sprang upon them as a lion</p>
    <p class=l>as when the lordly lion seeks his food</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fastens on the neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is<br />feeding in a coppice.</p>
    <p class=l>where grazing heifers range the lonely wood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for all their vain struggles he flung them<br />both from their chariot and stripped the armour from their</p>
    <p class=l>he leaps amidst them with a furious bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bodies.</p>
    <p class=l>bends their strong necks, and tears them to the ground:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he gave their horses to his comrades to take them</p>
    <p class=l>so from their seats the brother chiefs are torn,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>back to the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>their steeds and chariot to the navy borne.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went</p>
    <p class=l>with deep concern divine æneas view’d<br />the foe prevailing, and his friends pursued;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through the fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find</p>
    <p class=l>through the thick storm of singing spears he flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pandarus.</p>
    <p class=l>exploring pandarus with careful eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had found the brave son of lycaon he said,</p>
    <p class=l>at length he found lycaon’s mighty son;<br />to whom the chief of venus’ race begun:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“pandarus, where is now your bow, your winged arrows, and your</p>
    <p class=l>“where, pandarus, are all thy honours now,<br />thy winged arrows and unerring bow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>renown as an archer, in respect of which no man here can rival<br />you nor is there any in lycia that can beat you?<br />lift then your</p>
    <p class=l>thy matchless skill, thy yet unrivall’d fame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hands to jove and send an arrow at this fellow who is going so</p>
    <p class=l>and boasted glory of the lycian name?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>masterfully about, and has done such deadly work among the</p>
    <p class=l>o pierce that mortal!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>if we mortal call</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he has killed many a brave man—unless indeed he is some</p>
    <p class=l>that wondrous force by which whole armies fall;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>god who is angry with the trojans about their sacrifices, and</p>
    <p class=l>or god incensed, who quits the distant skies<br />to punish troy for slighted sacrifice;<br />(which, oh avert from our unhappy state!<br />for what so dreadful as celestial hate)?<br />whoe’er he be, propitiate jove with prayer;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>has set his hand against them in his displeasure.</p>
    <p class=l>if man, destroy; if god, entreat to spare.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and the son of lycaon answered, “aeneas, i take him for none</p>
    <p class=l>to him the lycian: “whom your eyes behold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>other than the son of tydeus.</p>
    <p class=l>if right i judge, is diomed the bold:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i know him by his shield, the visor</p>
    <p class=l>such coursers whirl him o’er the dusty field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of his helmet, and by his horses.</p>
    <p class=l>so towers his helmet, and so flames his shield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it is possible that he may be a<br />god, but if he is the man i say he is, he is not making all this</p>
    <p class=l>if ’tis a god, he wears that chief’s disguise:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>havoc without heaven’s help, but has some god by his side who is</p>
    <p class=l>or if that chief, some guardian of the skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shrouded in a cloud of darkness, and who turned my arrow aside</p>
    <p class=l>involved in clouds, protects him in the fray,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when it had hit him.</p>
    <p class=l>and turns unseen the frustrate dart away.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have taken aim at him already and hit him<br />on the right shoulder; my arrow went through the breast-piece of</p>
    <p class=l>i wing’d an arrow, which not idly fell,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his cuirass; and i made sure i should send him hurrying to the</p>
    <p class=l>the stroke had fix’d him to the gates of hell;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>world below, but it seems that i have not killed him.</p>
    <p class=l>and, but some god, some angry god withstands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there must</p>
    <p class=l>his fate was due to these unerring hands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be a god who is angry with me.</p>
    <p class=l>skill’d in the bow, on foot i sought the war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moreover i have neither horse nor</p>
    <p class=l>nor join’d swift horses to the rapid car.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariot.<br />in my father’s stables there are eleven excellent<br />chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with cloths spread</p>
    <p class=l>ten polish’d chariots i possess’d at home,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of horses,</p>
    <p class=l>and still they grace lycaon’s princely dome:<br />there veil’d in spacious coverlets they stand;<br />and twice ten coursers wait their lord’s command.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>champing barley and rye; my old father lycaon urged me again and</p>
    <p class=l>the good old warrior bade me trust to these,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>again when i was at home and on the point of starting, to take</p>
    <p class=l>when first for troy i sail’d the sacred seas;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariots and horses with me that i might lead the trojans in</p>
    <p class=l>in fields, aloft, the whirling car to guide,<br />and through the ranks of death triumphant ride.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battle, but i would not listen to him; it would have been much</p>
    <p class=l>but vain with youth, and yet to thrift inclined,<br />i heard his counsels with unheedful mind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>better if i had done so, but i was thinking about the horses,<br />which had been used to eat their fill, and i was afraid that in</p>
    <p class=l>and thought the steeds (your large supplies unknown)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>such a great gathering of men they might be ill-fed, so i left</p>
    <p class=l>might fail of forage in the straiten’d town;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them at home and came on foot to ilius armed only with my bow and</p>
    <p class=l>so took my bow and pointed darts in hand<br />and left the chariots in my native land.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>arrows.</p>
    <p class=l>“too late, o friend!<br />my rashness i deplore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these it seems, are of no use, for i have already hit two</p>
    <p class=l>these shafts, once fatal, carry death no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chieftains, the sons of atreus and of tydeus, and though i drew</p>
    <p class=l>tydeus’ and atreus’ sons their points have found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>blood surely enough, i have only made them still more furious.</p>
    <p class=l>and undissembled gore pursued the wound.<br />in vain they bleed: this unavailing bow<br />serves, not to slaughter, but provoke the foe.<br />in evil hour these bended horns i strung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i</p>
    <p class=l>and seized the quiver where it idly hung.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did ill to take my bow down from its peg on the day i led my band</p>
    <p class=l>cursed be the fate that sent me to the field</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of trojans to ilius in hector’s service, and if ever i get home</p>
    <p class=l>without a warrior’s arms, the spear and shield!<br />if e’er with life i quit the trojan plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>again to set eyes on my native place, my wife, and the greatness</p>
    <p class=l>if e’er i see my spouse and sire again,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of my house, may some one cut my head off then and there if i do</p>
    <p class=l>this bow, unfaithful to my glorious aims,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not break the bow and set it on a hot fire—such pranks as it</p>
    <p class=l>broke by my hand, shall feed the blazing flames.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>to whom the leader of the dardan race:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas answered, “say no more.</p>
    <p class=l>“be calm, nor phœbus’ honour’d gift disgrace.</p>

    <p class=l>the distant dart be praised, though here we need</p>

    <p class=r>trial of arms.</p>
    <p class=l>and, hand to hand, encounter force with force.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses</p>
    <p class=l>now mount my seat, and from the chariot’s height<br />observe my father’s steeds, renown’d in fight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of tros can speed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or</p>

    <p class=l>secure with these, through fighting fields we go;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if jove again vouchsafes glory to the son of tydeus they<br />will carry us safely back to the city.</p>
    <p class=l>or safe to troy, if jove assist the foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>take hold, then, of the</p>
    <p class=l>haste, seize the whip, and snatch the guiding rein;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whip and reins while i stand upon the car to fight, or else do</p>
    <p class=l>the warrior’s fury let this arm sustain;<br />or, if to combat thy bold heart incline,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you wait this man’s onset while i look after the horses.</p>
    <p class=l>take thou the spear, the chariot’s care be mine.</p>

    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”<br />“o prince!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“aeneas,” replied the son of lycaon, “take the reins and drive;</p>
    <p class=l>(lycaon’s valiant son replied)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if we have to fly before the son of tydeus the horses will go</p>
    <p class=l>as thine the steeds, be thine the task to guide.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>better for their own driver.</p>
    <p class=l>the horses, practised to their lord’s command,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if they miss the sound of your voice</p>
    <p class=l>shall bear the rein, and answer to thy hand;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they expect it they may be frightened, and refuse to take us</p>

    <p class=r>out of the fight.</p>
    <p class=l>thy voice alone can animate their flight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of tydeus will then kill both of us and</p>
    <p class=l>else shall our fates be number’d with the dead,</p>

    <p class=r>take the horses.</p>
    <p class=l>and these, the victor’s prize, in triumph led.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ready for him with my spear.</p>
    <p class=l>myself will charge this terror of the field.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they then mounted the chariot and drove full speed towards the</p>
    <p class=l>and now both heroes mount the glittering car;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of tydeus.</p>
    <p class=l>the bounding coursers rush amidst the war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sthenelus, son of capaneus, saw them coming and</p>
    <p class=l>their fierce approach bold sthenelus espied,</p>

    <p class=r>said to diomed, “diomed, son of tydeus, man after my own heart, i</p>

    <p class=r>see two heroes speeding towards you, both of them men of might</p>
    <p class=l>two chiefs of force immense i see,<br />dreadful they come, and bend their rage on thee:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the one a skilful archer, pandarus son of lycaon, the other,</p>
    <p class=l>lo the brave heir of old lycaon’s line,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas, whose sire is anchises, while his mother is venus.</p>
    <p class=l>and great æneas, sprung from race divine!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mount</p>
    <p class=l>enough is given to fame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the chariot and let us retreat.<br />do not, i pray you, press so</p>
    <p class=l>ascend thy car!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>furiously forward, or you may get killed.</p>
    <p class=l>and save a life, the bulwark of our war.</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed looked angrily at him and answered: “talk not of flight,</p>
    <p class=l>at this the hero cast a gloomy look,<br />fix’d on the chief with scorn; and thus he spoke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for i shall not listen to you: i am of a race that knows neither</p>
    <p class=l>“me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flight nor fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied.</p>
    <p class=l>me wouldst thou move to base, inglorious flight?<br />know, ’tis not honest in my soul to fear,<br />nor was tydides born to tremble here.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i am in no</p>
    <p class=l>i hate the cumbrous chariot’s slow advance,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mind to mount, but will go against them even as i am; pallas</p>
    <p class=l>and the long distance of the flying lance;<br />but while my nerves are strong, my force entire,<br />thus front the foe, and emulate my sire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva bids me be afraid of no man, and even though one of them</p>
    <p class=l>nor shall yon steeds, that fierce to fight convey</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>escape, their steeds shall not take both back again.</p>
    <p class=l>those threatening heroes, bear them both away;<br />one chief at least beneath this arm shall die;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i say</p>
    <p class=l>so pallas tells me, and forbids to fly.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>further, and lay my saying to your heart—if minerva sees fit to</p>
    <p class=l>but if she dooms, and if no god withstand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vouchsafe me the glory of killing both, stay your horses here and</p>
    <p class=l>that both shall fall by one victorious hand,<br />then heed my words: my horses here detain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot; then be sure you</p>
    <p class=l>fix’d to the chariot by the straiten’d rein;<br />swift to æneas’ empty seat proceed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spring aeneas’ horses and drive them from the trojan to the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in payment for his son ganymede, and are the finest that live and</p>
    <p class=l>the best that e’er on earth’s broad surface run,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>king anchises stole the blood by putting his<br />mares to them without laomedon’s knowledge, and they bore him six</p>

    <p class=r>foals.</p>
    <p class=l>by mortal mares, from fierce laomedon:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>four are still in his stables, but he gave the other two</p>
    <p class=l>four of this race his ample stalls contain,</p>

    <p class=r>to aeneas.</p>
    <p class=l>and two transport æneas o’er the plain.</p>

    <p class=r>we shall win great glory if we can take them.</p>
    <p class=l>these, were the rich immortal prize our own,<br />through the wide world should make our glory known.</p>

    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up</p>
    <p class=l>thus while they spoke, the foe came furious on,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son,” said he, “of noble tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low,</p>
    <p class=l>though late in vain assail’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so i will now try with my spear.</p>
    <p class=l>the spear may enter where the arrow fail’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him.</p>
    <p class=l>he said, then shook the ponderous lance, and flung;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it struck</p>
    <p class=l>on his broad shield the sounding weapon rung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the shield of the son of tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and</p>
    <p class=l>pierced the tough orb, and in his cuirass hung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>passed on till it reached the breastplate.</p>
    <p class=l>“he bleeds!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon the son of</p>
    <p class=l>the pride of greece!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lycaon shouted out and said, “you are hit clean through the</p>
    <p class=l>(the boaster cries,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>belly; you will not stand out for long, and the glory of the<br />fight is mine.</p>
    <p class=l>our triumph now, the mighty warrior lies!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”<br />“mistaken vaunter!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but diomed all undismayed made answer, “you have missed, not hit,</p>
    <p class=l>(diomed replied;)<br />thy dart has erred, and now my spear be tried;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and before you two see the end of this matter one or other of you</p>
    <p class=l>ye ’scape not both; one, headlong from his car,</p>

    <p class=r>shall glut tough-shielded mars with his blood.</p>

    <p class=r>with this he hurled his spear, and minerva guided it on to</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, and rising hurl’d his forceful dart,<br />which, driven by pallas, pierced a vital part;<br />full in his face it enter’d, and betwixt</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pandarus’s nose near the eye.</p>
    <p class=l>the nose and eye-ball the proud lycian fix’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it went crashing in among his white<br />teeth; the bronze point cut through the root of his tongue,</p>
    <p class=l>crash’d all his jaws, and cleft the tongue within,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>coming out under his chin, and his glistening armour rang</p>
    <p class=l>till the bright point look’d out beneath the chin.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>headlong he falls, his helmet knocks the ground:<br />earth groans beneath him, and his arms resound;</p>

    <p class=r>the horses</p>
    <p class=l>the starting coursers tremble with affright;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>started aside for fear, and he was reft of life and strength.</p>
    <p class=l>the soul indignant seeks the realms of night.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear,</p>
    <p class=l>to guard his slaughter’d friend, æneas flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fearing lest the achaeans should carry off the body.</p>
    <p class=l>his spear extending where the carcase lies;</p>

    <p class=r>he bestrode</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it as a lion in the pride of strength, with shield and spear</p>
    <p class=l>as the grim lion stalks around his prey.<br />o’er the fall’n trunk his ample shield display’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first that should dare face him.</p>
    <p class=l>and threats aloud!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but the son of tydeus caught up</p>
    <p class=l>the greeks with longing eyes<br />behold at distance, but forbear the prize.<br />then fierce tydides stoops; and from the fields</p>

    <p class=r>a mighty stone, so huge and great that as men now are it would</p>
    <p class=l>heaved with vast force, a rocky fragment wields.<br />not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,<br />such men as live in these degenerate days:[147]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>take two to lift it; nevertheless he bore it aloft with ease</p>
    <p class=l>he swung it round; and, gathering strength to throw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>unaided, and with this he struck aeneas on the groin where the</p>
    <p class=l>discharged the ponderous ruin at the foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hip turns in the joint that is called the “cup-bone.</p>
    <p class=l>where to the hip the inserted thigh unites,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>” the stone</p>
    <p class=l>full on the bone the pointed marble lights;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>crushed this joint, and broke both the sinews, while its jagged</p>
    <p class=l>through both the tendons broke the rugged stone,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>edges tore away all the flesh.</p>
    <p class=l>and stripp’d the skin, and crack’d the solid bone.</p>

    <p class=r>the hero fell on his knees, and</p>
    <p class=l>sunk on his knees, and staggering with his pains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>propped himself with his hand resting on the ground till the</p>
    <p class=l>his falling bulk his bended arm sustains;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>darkness of night fell upon his eyes.</p>
    <p class=l>lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies;<br />a sudden cloud comes swimming o’er his eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now aeneas, king of</p>
    <p class=l>there the brave chief, who mighty numbers sway’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men, would have perished then and there, had not his mother,</p>
    <p class=l>oppress’d had sunk to death’s eternal shade,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove’s daughter venus, who had conceived him by anchises when he</p>
    <p class=l>but heavenly venus, mindful of the love</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was herding cattle, been quick to mark, and thrown her two white</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>arms about the body of her dear son.</p>
    <p class=l>and guards her offspring with a mother’s care.<br />about her much-loved son her arms she throws,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she protected him by</p>
    <p class=l>her arms whose whiteness match the falling snows.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>covering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lest some</p>
    <p class=l>screen’d from the foe behind her shining veil,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him.</p>
    <p class=l>the swords wave harmless, and the javelins fail;<br />safe through the rushing horse, and feather’d flight</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight.</p>
    <p class=l>of sounding shafts, she bears him from the fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but the</p>
    <p class=l>nor sthenelus, with unassisting hands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of capaneus was not unmindful of the orders that diomed had</p>
    <p class=l>remain’d unheedful of his lord’s commands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>given him.</p>
    <p class=l>his panting steeds, removed from out the war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he made his own horses fast, away from the<br />hurly-burly, by binding the reins to the rim of the chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>he fix’d with straiten’d traces to the car,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then</p>
    <p class=l>next, rushing to the dardan spoil, detains</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he sprang upon aeneas’s horses and drove them from the trojan to</p>
    <p class=l>the heavenly coursers with the flowing manes:<br />these in proud triumph to the fleet convey’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaean ranks.</p>
    <p class=l>no longer now a trojan lord obey’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had so done he gave them over to his</p>
    <p class=l>that charge to bold deipylus he gave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chosen comrade deipylus, whom he valued above all others as the<br />one who was most like-minded with himself, to take them on to the<br />ships.</p>
    <p class=l>(whom most he loved, as brave men love the brave,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then remounted his own chariot, seized the reins, and</p>
    <p class=l>then mounting on his car, resumed the rein,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drove with all speed in search of the son of tydeus.</p>
    <p class=l>and follow’d where tydides swept the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now the son of tydeus was in pursuit of the cyprian goddess,</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile (his conquest ravished from his eyes)<br />the raging chief in chase of venus flies:<br />no goddess she, commission’d to the field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear in hand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those</p>
    <p class=l>like pallas dreadful with her sable shield,<br />or fierce bellona thundering at the wall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>goddesses that can lord it among men in battle like minerva or</p>
    <p class=l>while flames ascend, and mighty ruins fall;<br />he knew soft combats suit the tender dame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>enyo the waster of cities, and when at last after a long chase he</p>
    <p class=l>new to the field, and still a foe to fame.<br />through breaking ranks his furious course he bends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>caught her up, he flew at her and thrust his spear into the flesh</p>
    <p class=l>and at the goddess his broad lance extends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of her delicate hand.</p>
    <p class=l>through her bright veil the daring weapon drove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the point tore through the ambrosial robe</p>
    <p class=l>the ambrosial veil which all the graces wove;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which the graces had woven for her, and pierced the skin between</p>
    <p class=l>her snowy hand the razing steel profaned,<br />and the transparent skin with crimson stain’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her wrist and the palm of her hand, so that the immortal blood,</p>
    <p class=l>from the clear vein a stream immortal flow’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or ichor, that flows in the veins of the blessed gods, came</p>
    <p class=l>such stream as issues from a wounded god;[148]<br />pure emanation!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pouring from the wound; for the gods do not eat bread nor drink</p>
    <p class=l>uncorrupted flood!<br />unlike our gross, diseased, terrestrial blood:<br />(for not the bread of man their life sustains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wine, hence they have no blood such as ours, and are immortal.</p>
    <p class=l>nor wine’s inflaming juice supplies their veins:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall, but phoebus apollo</p>
    <p class=l>with tender shrieks the goddess fill’d the place,<br />and dropp’d her offspring from her weak embrace.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of darkness, lest</p>
    <p class=l>him phœbus took: he casts a cloud around</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him;</p>
    <p class=l>the fainting chief, and wards the mortal wound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and diomed shouted out as he left her, “daughter of jove, leave</p>
    <p class=l>then with a voice that shook the vaulted skies,<br />the king insults the goddess as she flies:<br />“ill with jove’s daughter bloody fights agree,</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=r>the goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and iris, fleet as</p>
    <p class=l>the goddess, seized with dread,<br />confused, distracted, from the conflict fled.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the wind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair</p>

    <p class=r>knees when he returns from battle.<br />let, then, the son of tydeus</p>
    <p class=l>no infant on his knees shall call him sire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see that he does not have to fight with one who is stronger than</p>
    <p class=l>strong as thou art, some god may yet be found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you are.</p>
    <p class=l>to stretch thee pale and gasping on the ground;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then shall his brave wife aegialeia, daughter of</p>
    <p class=l>thy distant wife, ægialé the fair,[151]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>adrestus, rouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss</p>
    <p class=l>starting from sleep with a distracted air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of her wedded lord, diomed the bravest of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>shall rouse thy slaves, and her lost lord deplore,<br />the brave, the great, the glorious now no more!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter<br />with both hands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was</p>
    <p class=l>this said, she wiped from venus’ wounded palm</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>healed.</p>
    <p class=l>the sacred ichor, and infused the balm.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but minerva and juno, who were looking on, began to taunt</p>
    <p class=l>juno and pallas with a smile survey’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove with their mocking talk, and minerva was first to speak.</p>
    <p class=l>and thus to jove began the blue-eyed maid:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“father jove,” said she, “do not be angry with me, but i think</p>
    <p class=l>“permit thy daughter, gracious jove!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the cyprian must have been persuading some one of the achaean</p>
    <p class=l>to tell</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>women to go with the trojans of whom she is so very fond, and</p>
    <p class=l>how this mischance the cyprian queen befell,<br />as late she tried with passion to inflame<br />the tender bosom of a grecian dame;<br />allured the fair, with moving thoughts of joy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while caressing one or other of them she must have torn her</p>
    <p class=l>to quit her country for some youth of troy;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>delicate hand with the gold pin of the woman’s brooch.</p>
    <p class=l>the clasping zone, with golden buckles bound,<br />razed her soft hand with this lamented wound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden venus to his</p>
    <p class=l>the sire of gods and men superior smiled,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>side.</p>
    <p class=l>and, calling venus, thus address’d his child:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my child,” said he, “it has not been given you to be a</p>
    <p class=l>“not these, o daughter are thy proper cares,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>warrior.</p>
    <p class=l>thee milder arts befit, and softer wars;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>attend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial</p>
    <p class=l>sweet smiles are thine, and kind endearing charms;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>duties, and leave all this fighting to mars and to minerva.</p>
    <p class=l>to mars and pallas leave the deeds of arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did they converse.</p>
    <p class=l>thus they in heaven: while on the plain below</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but diomed sprang upon aeneas, though he<br />knew him to be in the very arms of apollo.</p>
    <p class=l>the fierce tydides charged his dardan foe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not one whit did he</p>
    <p class=l>flush’d with celestial blood pursued his way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fear the mighty god, so set was he on killing aeneas and</p>
    <p class=l>and fearless dared the threatening god of day;<br />already in his hopes he saw him kill’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stripping him of his armour.</p>
    <p class=l>though screen’d behind apollo’s mighty shield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thrice did he spring forward with<br />might and main to slay him, and thrice did apollo beat back his</p>
    <p class=l>thrice rushing furious, at the chief he strook;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gleaming shield.</p>
    <p class=l>his blazing buckler thrice apollo shook:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he was coming on for the fourth time, as</p>
    <p class=l>he tried the fourth: when, breaking from the cloud,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>though he were a god, apollo shouted to him with an awful voice</p>
    <p class=l>a more than mortal voice was heard aloud.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and said, “take heed, son of tydeus, and draw off; think not to</p>
    <p class=l>“o son of tydeus, cease!<br />be wise and see</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>match yourself against gods, for men that walk the earth cannot</p>
    <p class=l>how vast the difference of the gods and thee;<br />distance immense!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hold their own with the immortals.</p>
    <p class=l>between the powers that shine<br />above, eternal, deathless, and divine,<br />and mortal man!<br />a wretch of humble birth,<br />a short-lived reptile in the dust of earth.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the</p>
    <p class=l>so spoke the god who darts celestial fires:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>anger of the god, while apollo took aeneas out of the crowd and</p>
    <p class=l>he dreads his fury, and some steps retires.<br />then phœbus bore the chief of venus’ race</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>set him in sacred pergamus, where his temple stood.</p>
    <p class=l>to troy’s high fane, and to his holy place;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there, within<br />the mighty sanctuary, latona and diana healed him and made him</p>
    <p class=l>latona there and phoebe heal’d the wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glorious to behold, while apollo of the silver bow fashioned a</p>
    <p class=l>with vigour arm’d him, and with glory crown’d.<br />this done, the patron of the silver bow</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wraith in the likeness of aeneas, and armed as he was.</p>
    <p class=l>a phantom raised, the same in shape and show<br />with great æneas; such the form he bore,<br />and such in fight the radiant arms he wore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>round this</p>
    <p class=l>around the spectre bloody wars are waged,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans and achaeans hacked at the bucklers about one<br />another’s breasts, hewing each other’s round shields and light<br />hide-covered targets.</p>
    <p class=l>and greece and troy with clashing shields engaged.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then phoebus apollo said to mars, “mars,</p>
    <p class=l>meantime on ilion’s tower apollo stood,<br />and calling mars, thus urged the raging god:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mars, bane of men, blood-stained stormer of cities, can you not</p>
    <p class=l>“stern power of arms, by whom the mighty fall;<br />who bathest in blood, and shakest the embattled wall,<br />rise in thy wrath!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>go to this man, the son of tydeus, who would now fight even with</p>
    <p class=l>to hell’s abhorr’d abodes</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father jove, and draw him out of the battle?</p>
    <p class=l>despatch yon greek, and vindicate the gods.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he first went up to</p>
    <p class=l>first rosy venus felt his brutal rage;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and</p>
    <p class=l>me next he charged, and dares all heaven engage:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>afterwards sprang upon me too, as though he were a god.</p>
    <p class=l>the wretch would brave high heaven’s immortal sire,<br />his triple thunder, and his bolts of fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then took his seat on the top of pergamus, while murderous</p>
    <p class=l>the god of battle issues on the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mars went about among the ranks of the trojans, cheering them on,</p>
    <p class=l>stirs all the ranks, and fires the trojan train;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the likeness of fleet acamas chief of the thracians.</p>
    <p class=l>in form like acamas, the thracian guide,<br />enraged to troy’s retiring chiefs he cried:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“sons of</p>
    <p class=l>“how long, ye sons of priam!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam,” said he, “how long will you let your people be thus</p>
    <p class=l>will ye fly,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>slaughtered by the achaeans?</p>
    <p class=l>and unrevenged see priam’s people die?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would you wait till they are at the</p>
    <p class=l>still unresisted shall the foe destroy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>walls of troy?</p>
    <p class=l>and stretch the slaughter to the gates of troy?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas the son of anchises has fallen, he whom we<br />held in as high honour as hector himself.</p>
    <p class=l>lo, brave æneas sinks beneath his wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>help me, then, to</p>
    <p class=l>not godlike hector more in arms renown’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rescue our brave comrade from the stress of the fight.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>haste all, and take the generous warrior’s part.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he put heart and soul into them all.</p>
    <p class=l>he said;—new courage swell’d each hero’s heart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then<br />sarpedon rebuked hector very sternly.</p>
    <p class=l>sarpedon first his ardent soul express’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“hector,” said he, “where</p>
    <p class=l>and, turn’d to hector, these bold words address’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is your prowess now?</p>
    <p class=l>“say, chief, is all thy ancient valour lost?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you used to say that though you had neither</p>
    <p class=l>where are thy threats, and where thy glorious boast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>people nor allies you could hold the town alone with your</p>
    <p class=l>that propp’d alone by priam’s race should stand<br />troy’s sacred walls, nor need a foreign hand?<br />now, now thy country calls her wonted friends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brothers and brothers-in-law.</p>
    <p class=l>and the proud vaunt in just derision ends.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i see not one of them here; they</p>
    <p class=l>remote they stand while alien troops engage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cower as hounds before a lion; it is we, your allies, who bear<br />the brunt of the battle.</p>
    <p class=l>like trembling hounds before the lion’s rage.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have come from afar, even from lycia</p>
    <p class=l>far distant hence i held my wide command,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and the banks of the river xanthus, where i have left my wife, my</p>
    <p class=l>where foaming xanthus laves the lycian land;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever is needy;</p>
    <p class=l>with ample wealth (the wish of mortals) bless’d,<br />a beauteous wife, and infant at her breast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevertheless, i head my lycian soldiers and stand my ground</p>
    <p class=l>with those i left whatever dear could be:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against any who would fight me though i have nothing here for the</p>
    <p class=l>greece, if she conquers, nothing wins from me;<br />yet first in fight my lycian bands i cheer,<br />and long to meet this mighty man ye fear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans to plunder, while you look on, without even bidding your</p>
    <p class=l>while hector idle stands, nor bids the brave</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men stand firm in defence of their wives.</p>
    <p class=l>their wives, their infants, and their altars save.<br />haste, warrior, haste!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see that you fall not</p>
    <p class=l>preserve thy threaten’d state,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into the hands of your foes as men caught in the meshes of a net,</p>
    <p class=l>or one vast burst of all-involving fate</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and they sack your fair city forthwith.</p>
    <p class=l>full o’er your towers shall fall, and sweep away</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>keep this before your</p>
    <p class=l>sons, sires, and wives, an undistinguish’d prey.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mind night and day, and beseech the captains of your allies to</p>
    <p class=l>rouse all thy trojans, urge thy aids to fight;<br />these claim thy thoughts by day, thy watch by night;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hold on without flinching, and thus put away their reproaches</p>
    <p class=l>with force incessant the brave greeks oppose;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from you.</p>
    <p class=l>such cares thy friends deserve, and such thy foes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so spoke sarpedon, and hector smarted under his words.</p>
    <p class=l>stung to the heart the generous hector hears,<br />but just reproof with decent silence bears.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he sprang</p>
    <p class=l>from his proud car the prince impetuous springs,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from his chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among</p>
    <p class=l>on earth he leaps, his brazen armour rings.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the host brandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight</p>
    <p class=l>two shining spears are brandish’d in his hands;<br />thus arm’d, he animates his drooping bands,<br />revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and raising the terrible cry of battle.</p>
    <p class=l>and wakes anew the dying flames of fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then they rallied and<br />again faced the achaeans, but the argives stood compact and firm,</p>
    <p class=l>they turn, they stand; the greeks their fury dare,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and were not driven back.</p>
    <p class=l>condense their powers, and wait the growing war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as the breezes sport with the chaff<br />upon some goodly threshing-floor, when men are winnowing—while</p>
    <p class=l>as when, on ceres’ sacred floor, the swain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yellow ceres blows with the wind to sift the chaff from the</p>
    <p class=l>spreads the wide fan to clear the golden grain,<br />and the light chaff, before the breezes borne,<br />ascends in clouds from off the heapy corn;<br />the grey dust, rising with collected winds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grain, and the chaff-heaps grow whiter and whiter—even so did the</p>
    <p class=l>drives o’er the barn, and whitens all the hinds:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses’ hoofs raised to the</p>
    <p class=l>so white with dust the grecian host appears,<br />from trampling steeds, and thundering charioteers.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>firmament of heaven, as their drivers turned them back to battle,</p>
    <p class=l>the dusky clouds from labour’d earth arise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and they bore down with might upon the foe.</p>
    <p class=l>and roll in smoking volumes to the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fierce mars, to help</p>
    <p class=l>mars hovers o’er them with his sable shield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans, covered them in a veil of darkness, and went about</p>
    <p class=l>and adds new horrors to the darken’d field:<br />pleased with his charge, and ardent to fulfil,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>everywhere among them, inasmuch as phoebus apollo had told him</p>
    <p class=l>in troy’s defence, apollo’s heavenly will:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that when he saw pallas minerva leave the fray he was to put<br />courage into the hearts of the trojans—for it was she who was</p>
    <p class=l>soon as from fight the blue-eyed maid retires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>helping the danaans.</p>
    <p class=l>each trojan bosom with new warmth he fires.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then apollo sent aeneas forth from his rich</p>
    <p class=l>and now the god, from forth his sacred fane,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sanctuary, and filled his heart with valour, whereon he took his</p>
    <p class=l>produced æneas to the shouting train;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>place among his comrades, who were overjoyed at seeing him alive,</p>
    <p class=l>alive, unharm’d, with all his peers around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sound, and of a good courage; but they could not ask him how it</p>
    <p class=l>erect he stood, and vigorous from his wound:<br />inquiries none they made; the dreadful day<br />no pause of words admits, no dull delay;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had all happened, for they were too busy with the turmoil raised</p>
    <p class=l>fierce discord storms, apollo loud exclaims,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by mars and by strife, who raged insatiably in their midst.</p>
    <p class=l>fame calls, mars thunders, and the field’s in flames.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the two ajaxes, ulysses and diomed, cheered the danaans on,</p>
    <p class=l>stern diomed with either ajax stood,<br />and great ulysses, bathed in hostile blood.<br />embodied close, the labouring grecian train</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fearless of the fury and onset of the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>the fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they stood as</p>
    <p class=l>unmoved and silent, the whole war they wait</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>still as clouds which the son of saturn has spread upon the</p>
    <p class=l>serenely dreadful, and as fix’d as fate.<br />so when the embattled clouds in dark array,<br />along the skies their gloomy lines display;<br />when now the north his boisterous rage has spent,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mountain tops when there is no air and fierce boreas sleeps with</p>
    <p class=l>and peaceful sleeps the liquid element:<br />the low-hung vapours, motionless and still,<br />rest on the summits of the shaded hill;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the other boisterous winds whose shrill blasts scatter the clouds</p>
    <p class=l>till the mass scatters as the winds arise,<br />dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in all directions—even so did the danaans stand firm and</p>
    <p class=l>nor was the general wanting to his train;<br />from troop to troop he toils through all the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>unflinching against the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>“ye greeks, be men!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of atreus went about</p>
    <p class=l>the charge of battle bear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among them and exhorted them.</p>
    <p class=l>your brave associates and yourselves revere!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my friends,” said he, “quit</p>
    <p class=l>let glorious acts more glorious acts inspire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in one another’s</p>
    <p class=l>and catch from breast to breast the noble fire!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eyes amid the stress of battle.</p>
    <p class=l>on valour’s side the odds of combat lie,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they that shun dishonour more</p>
    <p class=l>the brave live glorious, or lamented die;<br />the wretch who trembles in the field of fame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>often live than get killed, but they that fly save neither life</p>
    <p class=l>meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nor name.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in</p>
    <p class=l>these words he seconds with his flying lance,<br />to meet whose point was strong deicoon’s chance:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the front rank, the comrade of aeneas, deicoon son of pergasus,</p>
    <p class=l>æneas’ friend, and in his native place</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whom the trojans held in no less honour than the sons of priam,</p>
    <p class=l>honour’d and loved like priam’s royal race:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for he was ever quick to place himself among the foremost.<br />the</p>
    <p class=l>long had he fought the foremost in the field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear of king agamemnon struck his shield and went right through</p>
    <p class=l>but now the monarch’s lance transpierced his shield:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it, for the shield stayed it not.</p>
    <p class=l>his shield too weak the furious dart to stay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it drove through his belt into</p>
    <p class=l>through his broad belt the weapon forced its way:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the lower part of his belly, and his armour rang rattling round</p>
    <p class=l>the grisly wound dismiss’d his soul to hell,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him as he fell heavily to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>his arms around him rattled as he fell.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then aeneas killed two champions of the danaans, crethon and</p>
    <p class=l>then fierce æneas, brandishing his blade,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>orsilochus.</p>
    <p class=l>in dust orsilochus and crethon laid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their father was a rich man who lived in the strong</p>
    <p class=l>whose sire diocleus, wealthy, brave and great,<br />in well-built pheræ held his lofty seat:[152]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>city of phere and was descended from the river alpheus, whose</p>
    <p class=l>sprung from alpheus’ plenteous stream, that yields</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>broad stream flows through the land of the pylians.<br />the river</p>
    <p class=l>increase of harvests to the pylian fields.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>begat orsilochus, who ruled over much people and was father to</p>
    <p class=l>he got orsilochus, diocleus he,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diocles, who in his turn begat twin sons, crethon and orsilochus,</p>
    <p class=l>and these descended in the third degree.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>well skilled in all the arts of war.</p>
    <p class=l>too early expert in the martial toil,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these, when they grew up,</p>
    <p class=l>in sable ships they left their native soil,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went to ilius with the argive fleet in the cause of menelaus and</p>
    <p class=l>to avenge atrides: now, untimely slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon sons of atreus, and there they both of them fell.</p>
    <p class=l>they fell with glory on the phrygian plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as</p>
    <p class=l>so two young mountain lions, nursed with blood</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two lions whom their dam has reared in the depths of some</p>
    <p class=l>in deep recesses of the gloomy wood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mountain forest to plunder homesteads and carry off sheep and</p>
    <p class=l>rush fearless to the plains, and uncontroll’d<br />depopulate the stalls and waste the fold:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cattle till they get killed by the hand of man, so were these two</p>
    <p class=l>till pierced at distance from their native den,<br />o’erpowered they fall beneath the force of men.<br />prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vanquished by aeneas, and fell like high pine-trees to the</p>
    <p class=l>like mountain firs, as tall and straight as they.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ground.</p>
    <p class=l>great menelaus views with pitying eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brave menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the<br />front, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for</p>
    <p class=l>lifts his bright lance, and at the victor flies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mars egged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed</p>
    <p class=l>mars urged him on; yet, ruthless in his hate,<br />the god but urged him to provoke his fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by aeneas; but antilochus the son of nestor saw him and sprang</p>
    <p class=l>he thus advancing, nestor’s valiant son</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forward, fearing that the king might come to harm and thus bring</p>
    <p class=l>shakes for his danger, and neglects his own;<br />struck with the thought, should helen’s lord be slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all their labour to nothing; when, therefore aeneas and menelaus</p>
    <p class=l>and all his country’s glorious labours vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were setting their hands and spears against one another eager to</p>
    <p class=l>already met, the threatening heroes stand;<br />the spears already tremble in their hand:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do battle, antilochus placed himself by the side of menelaus.</p>
    <p class=l>in rush’d antilochus, his aid to bring,<br />and fall or conquer by the spartan king.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas, bold though he was, drew back on seeing the two heroes<br />side by side in front of him, so they drew the bodies of crethon</p>
    <p class=l>these seen, the dardan backward turn’d his course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and orsilochus to the ranks of the achaeans and committed the two</p>
    <p class=l>brave as he was, and shunn’d unequal force.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>poor fellows into the hands of their comrades.</p>
    <p class=l>the breathless bodies to the greeks they drew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they then turned<br />back and fought in the front ranks.</p>
    <p class=l>then mix in combat, and their toils renew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they killed pylaemenes peer of mars, leader of the paphlagonian<br />warriors.</p>
    <p class=l>first, pylæmenes, great in battle, bled,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was</p>
    <p class=l>who sheathed in brass the paphlagonians led.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>standing on his chariot, while antilochus hit his charioteer and</p>
    <p class=l>atrides mark’d him where sublime he stood;<br />fix’d in his throat the javelin drank his blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>squire mydon, the son of atymnius, who was turning his horses in</p>
    <p class=l>the faithful mydon, as he turn’d from fight</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flight.</p>
    <p class=l>his flying coursers, sunk to endless night;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he hit him with a stone upon the elbow, and the reins,</p>
    <p class=l>a broken rock by nestor’s son was thrown:<br />his bended arm received the falling stone;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>enriched with white ivory, fell from his hands into the dust.</p>
    <p class=l>from his numb’d hand the ivory-studded reins,<br />dropp’d in the dust, are trail’d along the plains:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>antilochus rushed towards him and struck him on the temples with</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound;<br />he groans in death, and ponderous sinks to ground:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his sword, whereon he fell head first from the chariot to the<br />ground.</p>
    <p class=l>deep drove his helmet in the sands, and there</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there he stood for a while with his head and shoulders</p>
    <p class=l>the head stood fix’d, the quivering legs in air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>buried deep in the dust—for he had fallen on sandy soil till his</p>
    <p class=l>till trampled flat beneath the coursers’ feet:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as antilochus</p>
    <p class=l>the youthful victor mounts his empty seat,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lashed them and drove them off to the host of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>and bears the prize in triumph to the fleet.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry</p>
    <p class=l>great hector saw, and, raging at the view,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the</p>
    <p class=l>pours on the greeks: the trojan troops pursue:<br />he fires his host with animating cries,<br />and brings along the furies of the skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>mars, stern destroyer!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mars and dread enyo led them on, she fraught with</p>
    <p class=l>and bellona dread,<br />flame in the front, and thunder at their head:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ruthless turmoil of battle, while mars wielded a monstrous spear,</p>
    <p class=l>this swells the tumult and the rage of fight;<br />that shakes a spear that casts a dreadful light.<br />where hector march’d, the god of battles shined,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and went about, now in front of hector and now behind him.</p>
    <p class=l>now storm’d before him, and now raged behind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed shook with passion as he saw them.</p>
    <p class=l>tydides paused amidst his full career;<br />then first the hero’s manly breast knew fear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as a man crossing a</p>
    <p class=l>as when some simple swain his cot forsakes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wide plain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great</p>
    <p class=l>and wide through fens an unknown journey takes:<br />if chance a swelling brook his passage stay,<br />and foam impervious ’cross the wanderer’s way,<br />confused he stops, a length of country pass’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>river rolling swiftly to the sea—he sees its boiling waters and</p>
    <p class=l>eyes the rough waves, and tired, returns at last.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>starts back in fear—even so did the son of tydeus give ground.</p>
    <p class=l>amazed no less the great tydides stands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he said to his men, “my friends, how can we wonder that</p>
    <p class=l>he stay’d, and turning thus address’d his bands:<br />“no wonder, greeks!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector wields the spear so well?</p>
    <p class=l>that all to hector yield;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some god is ever by his side to</p>
    <p class=l>secure of favouring gods, he takes the field;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>protect him, and now mars is with him in the likeness of mortal</p>
    <p class=l>his strokes they second, and avert our spears.<br />behold where mars in mortal arms appears!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>man.</p>
    <p class=l>retire then, warriors, but sedate and slow;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>keep your faces therefore towards the trojans, but give</p>
    <p class=l>retire, but with your faces to the foe.<br />trust not too much your unavailing might;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ground backwards, for we dare not fight with gods.</p>
    <p class=l>’tis not with troy, but with the gods ye fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke the trojans drew close up, and hector killed two men,</p>
    <p class=l>now near the greeks the black battalions drew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>both in one chariot, menesthes and anchialus, heroes well versed</p>
    <p class=l>and first two leaders valiant hector slew:<br />his force anchialus and mnesthes found,<br />in every art of glorious war renown’d;<br />in the same car the chiefs to combat ride,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in war.</p>
    <p class=l>and fought united, and united died.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax son of telamon pitied them in their fall; he came</p>
    <p class=l>struck at the sight, the mighty ajax glows</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>close up and hurled his spear, hitting amphius the son of</p>
    <p class=l>with thirst of vengeance, and assaults the foes.<br />his massy spear with matchless fury sent,<br />through amphius’ belt and heaving belly went;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>selagus, a man of great wealth who lived in paesus and owned much</p>
    <p class=l>amphius apæsus’ happy soil possess’d,<br />with herds abounding, and with treasure bless’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>corn-growing land, but his lot had led him to come to the aid of</p>
    <p class=l>but fate resistless from his country led</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam and his sons.</p>
    <p class=l>the chief, to perish at his people’s head.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax struck him in the belt; the spear<br />pierced the lower part of his belly, and he fell heavily to the<br />ground.</p>
    <p class=l>shook with his fall his brazen armour rung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then ajax ran towards him to strip him of his armour, but</p>
    <p class=l>and fierce, to seize it, conquering ajax sprung;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans rained spears upon him, many of which fell upon his</p>
    <p class=l>around his head an iron tempest rain’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shield.</p>
    <p class=l>a wood of spears his ample shield sustain’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he planted his heel upon the body and drew out his spear,</p>
    <p class=l>beneath one foot the yet warm corpse he press’d,<br />and drew his javelin from the bleeding breast:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but the darts pressed so heavily upon him that he could not strip</p>
    <p class=l>he could no more; the showering darts denied</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the goodly armour from his shoulders.</p>
    <p class=l>to spoil his glittering arms, and plumy pride.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojan chieftains,</p>
    <p class=l>now foes on foes came pouring on the fields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moreover, many and valiant, came about him with their spears, so</p>
    <p class=l>with bristling lances, and compacted shields;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that he dared not stay; great, brave and valiant though he was,</p>
    <p class=l>till in the steely circle straiten’d round,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they drove him from them and he was beaten back.</p>
    <p class=l>forced he gives way, and sternly quits the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus, then, did the battle rage between them.</p>
    <p class=l>while thus they strive, tlepolemus the great,[153]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>presently the</p>
    <p class=l>urged by the force of unresisted fate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strong hand of fate impelled tlepolemus, the son of hercules, a</p>
    <p class=l>burns with desire sarpedon’s strength to prove;<br />alcides’ offspring meets the son of jove.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>man both brave and of great stature, to fight sarpedon; so the</p>
    <p class=l>sheathed in bright arms each adverse chief came on.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two, son and grandson of great jove, drew near to one another,</p>
    <p class=l>jove’s great descendant, and his greater son.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and tlepolemus spoke first.</p>
    <p class=l>prepared for combat, ere the lance he toss’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“sarpedon,” said he, “councillor of</p>
    <p class=l>the daring rhodian vents his haughty boast:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the lycians, why should you come skulking here you who are a man</p>
    <p class=l>“what brings this lycian counsellor so far,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of peace?</p>
    <p class=l>to tremble at our arms, not mix in war!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they lie who call you son of aegis-bearing jove, for</p>
    <p class=l>know thy vain self, nor let their flattery move,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you are little like those who were of old his children.</p>
    <p class=l>who style thee son of cloud-compelling jove.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>far other</p>
    <p class=l>how far unlike those chiefs of race divine,<br />how vast the difference of their deeds and thine!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was hercules, my own brave and lion-hearted father, who came here</p>
    <p class=l>jove got such heroes as my sire, whose soul<br />no fear could daunt, nor earth nor hell control.<br />troy felt his arm, and yon proud ramparts stand<br />raised on the ruins of his vengeful hand:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the horses of laomedon, and though he had six ships only, and</p>
    <p class=l>with six small ships, and but a slender train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>few men to follow him, sacked the city of ilius and made a<br />wilderness of her highways.</p>
    <p class=l>he left the town a wide-deserted plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you are a coward, and your people are</p>
    <p class=l>but what art thou, who deedless look’st around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>falling from you.</p>
    <p class=l>while unrevenged thy lycians bite the ground!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for all your strength, and all your coming from</p>
    <p class=l>small aid to troy thy feeble force can be;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lycia, you will be no help to the trojans but will pass the gates</p>
    <p class=l>but wert thou greater, thou must yield to me.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of hades vanquished by my hand.</p>
    <p class=l>pierced by my spear, to endless darkness go!<br />i make this present to the shades below.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and sarpedon, captain of the lycians, answered, “tlepolemus, your</p>
    <p class=l>the son of hercules, the rhodian guide,<br />thus haughty spoke.<br />the lycian king replied:<br />“thy sire, o prince!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father overthrew ilius by reason of laomedon’s folly in refusing</p>
    <p class=l>o’erturn’d the trojan state,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>payment to one who had served him well.</p>
    <p class=l>whose perjured monarch well deserved his fate;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he would not give your</p>
    <p class=l>those heavenly steeds the hero sought so far,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father the horses which he had come so far to fetch.</p>
    <p class=l>false he detain’d, the just reward of war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as for</p>
    <p class=l>nor so content, the generous chief defied,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yourself, you shall meet death by my spear.</p>
    <p class=l>with base reproaches and unmanly pride.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you shall yield glory</p>
    <p class=l>but you, unworthy the high race you boast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to myself, and your soul to hades of the noble steeds.</p>
    <p class=l>shall raise my glory when thy own is lost:<br />now meet thy fate, and by sarpedon slain,<br />add one more ghost to pluto’s gloomy reign.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus spoke sarpedon, and tlepolemus upraised his spear.</p>
    <p class=l>he said: both javelins at an instant flew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they<br />threw at the same moment, and sarpedon struck his foe in the</p>
    <p class=l>both struck, both wounded, but sarpedon’s slew:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>middle of his throat; the spear went right through, and the</p>
    <p class=l>full in the boaster’s neck the weapon stood,<br />transfix’d his throat, and drank the vital blood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>darkness of death fell upon his eyes.</p>
    <p class=l>the soul disdainful seeks the caves of night,<br />and his seal’d eyes for ever lose the light.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tlepolemus’s spear struck</p>
    <p class=l>yet not in vain, tlepolemus, was thrown<br />thy angry lance; which piercing to the bone</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sarpedon on the left thigh with such force that it tore through</p>
    <p class=l>sarpedon’s thigh, had robb’d the chief of breath;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the flesh and grazed the bone, but his father as yet warded off</p>
    <p class=l>but jove was present, and forbade the death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>destruction from him.<br />his comrades bore sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the</p>
    <p class=l>borne from the conflict by his lycian throng,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>weight of the spear that was dragging from his wound.</p>
    <p class=l>the wounded hero dragg’d the lance along.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were</p>
    <p class=l>(his friends, each busied in his several part,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in such haste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of</p>
    <p class=l>through haste, or danger, had not drawn the dart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drawing the spear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly.</p>
    <p class=l>)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the achaeans carried off the body of tlepolemus,</p>
    <p class=l>the greeks with slain tlepolemus retired;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whereon ulysses was moved to pity, and panted for the fray as he<br />beheld them.</p>
    <p class=l>whose fall ulysses view’d, with fury fired;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he doubted whether to pursue the son of jove, or to</p>
    <p class=l>doubtful if jove’s great son he should pursue,<br />or pour his vengeance on the lycian crew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>make slaughter of the lycian rank and file; it was not decreed,</p>
    <p class=l>but heaven and fate the first design withstand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>however, that he should slay the son of jove; minerva, therefore,</p>
    <p class=l>nor this great death must grace ulysses’ hand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>turned him against the main body of the lycians.<br />he killed</p>
    <p class=l>minerva drives him on the lycian train;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>coeranus, alastor, chromius, alcandrus, halius, noemon, and</p>
    <p class=l>alastor, cronius, halius, strew’d the plain,<br />alcander, prytanis, noëmon fell:[154]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>prytanis, and would have slain yet more, had not great hector</p>
    <p class=l>and numbers more his sword had sent to hell,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>marked him, and sped to the front of the fight clad in his suit</p>
    <p class=l>but hector saw; and, furious at the sight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of mail, filling the danaans with terror.</p>
    <p class=l>rush’d terrible amidst the ranks of fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sarpedon was glad when</p>
    <p class=l>with joy sarpedon view’d the wish’d relief,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he saw him coming, and besought him, saying, “son of priam, let</p>
    <p class=l>and, faint, lamenting, thus implored the chief:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me not be here to fall into the hands of the danaans.</p>
    <p class=l>“o suffer not the foe to bear away</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>help me,</p>
    <p class=l>my helpless corpse, an unassisted prey;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and since i may not return home to gladden the hearts of my wife</p>
    <p class=l>if i, unbless’d, must see my son no more,<br />my much-loved consort, and my native shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and of my infant son, let me die within the walls of your city.</p>
    <p class=l>yet let me die in ilion’s sacred wall;<br />troy, in whose cause i fell, shall mourn my fall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon</p>
    <p class=l>he said, nor hector to the chief replies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans and kill many among them.</p>
    <p class=l>but shakes his plume, and fierce to combat flies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his comrades then bore</p>
    <p class=l>swift as a whirlwind, drives the scattering foes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sarpedon away and laid him beneath jove’s spreading oak tree.</p>
    <p class=l>and dyes the ground with purple as he goes.<br />beneath a beech, jove’s consecrated shade,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pelagon, his friend and comrade, drew the spear out of his thigh,</p>
    <p class=l>his mournful friends divine sarpedon laid:<br />brave pelagon, his favourite chief, was nigh,<br />who wrench’d the javelin from his sinewy thigh.<br />the fainting soul stood ready wing’d for flight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but sarpedon fainted and a mist came over his eyes.<br />presently he</p>
    <p class=l>and o’er his eye-balls swam the shades of night;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came to himself again, for the breath of the north wind as it<br />played upon him gave him new life, and brought him out of the</p>
    <p class=l>but boreas rising fresh, with gentle breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deep swoon into which he had fallen.</p>
    <p class=l>recall’d his spirit from the gates of death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the argives were neither driven towards their ships by</p>
    <p class=l>the generous greeks recede with tardy pace,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mars and hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew</p>
    <p class=l>though mars and hector thunder in their face;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that mars was with the trojans they retreated, but kept their</p>
    <p class=l>none turn their backs to mean ignoble flight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>faces still turned towards the foe.</p>
    <p class=l>slow they retreat, and even retreating fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who, then, was first and who<br />last to be slain by mars and hector?</p>
    <p class=l>who first, who last, by mars’ and hector’s hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were valiant teuthras,</p>
    <p class=l>stretch’d in their blood, lay gasping on the sand?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and orestes the renowned charioteer, trechus the aetolian</p>
    <p class=l>tenthras the great, orestes the renown’d<br />for managed steeds, and trechus press’d the ground;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>warrior, oenomaus, helenus the son of oenops, and oresbius of the</p>
    <p class=l>next œnomaus and oenops’ offspring died;<br />oresbius last fell groaning at their side:<br />oresbius, in his painted mitre gay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gleaming girdle, who was possessed of great wealth, and dwelt by</p>
    <p class=l>in fat bœotia held his wealthy sway,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the cephisian lake with the other boeotians who lived near him,</p>
    <p class=l>where lakes surround low hylè’s watery plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>owners of a fertile country.</p>
    <p class=l>a prince and people studious of their gain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now when the goddess juno saw the argives thus falling, she said</p>
    <p class=l>the carnage juno from the skies survey’d,<br />and touch’d with grief bespoke the blue-eyed maid:<br />“oh, sight accursed!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to minerva, “alas, daughter of aegis-bearing jove, unweariable,</p>
    <p class=l>shall faithless troy prevail,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the promise we made menelaus that he should not return till he</p>
    <p class=l>and shall our promise to our people fail?<br />how vain the word to menelaus given<br />by jove’s great daughter and the queen of heaven,<br />beneath his arms that priam’s towers should fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had sacked the city of ilius will be of no effect if we let mars</p>
    <p class=l>if warring gods for ever guard the wall!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rage thus furiously.</p>
    <p class=l>mars, red with slaughter, aids our hated foes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us go into the fray at once.</p>
    <p class=l>haste, let us arm, and force with force oppose!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva did not gainsay her.</p>
    <p class=l>she spoke; minerva burns to meet the war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon the august goddess, daughter</p>
    <p class=l>and now heaven’s empress calls her blazing car.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of great saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds.</p>
    <p class=l>at her command rush forth the steeds divine;<br />rich with immortal gold their trappings shine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hebe</p>
    <p class=l>bright hebe waits; by hebe, ever young,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with all speed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that</p>
    <p class=l>the whirling wheels are to the chariot hung.<br />on the bright axle turns the bidden wheel</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were on either side of the iron axle-tree.</p>
    <p class=l>of sounding brass; the polished axle steel.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the felloes of the</p>
    <p class=l>eight brazen spokes in radiant order flame;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wheels were of gold, imperishable, and over these there was a</p>
    <p class=l>the circles gold, of uncorrupted frame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tire of bronze, wondrous to behold.</p>
    <p class=l>such as the heavens produce: and round the gold</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the naves of the wheels were</p>
    <p class=l>two brazen rings of work divine were roll’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>silver, turning round the axle upon either side.</p>
    <p class=l>the bossy naves of sold silver shone;<br />braces of gold suspend the moving throne:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the car itself</p>
    <p class=l>the car, behind, an arching figure bore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was made with plaited bands of gold and silver, and it had a<br />double top-rail running all round it.<br />from the body of the car</p>
    <p class=l>the bending concave form’d an arch before.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there went a pole of silver, on to the end of which she bound the<br />golden yoke, with the bands of gold that were to go under the</p>
    <p class=l>silver the beam, the extended yoke was gold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>necks of the horses.</p>
    <p class=l>and golden reins the immortal coursers hold.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then juno put her steeds under the yoke,</p>
    <p class=l>herself, impatient, to the ready car,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eager for battle and the war-cry.</p>
    <p class=l>the coursers joins, and breathes revenge and war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with</p>
    <p class=l>pallas disrobes; her radiant veil untied,<br />with flowers adorn’d, with art diversified,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her own hands, on to her father’s threshold, and donned the shirt</p>
    <p class=l>(the laboured veil her heavenly fingers wove,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of jove, arming herself for battle.</p>
    <p class=l>flows on the pavement of the court of jove.<br />now heaven’s dread arms her mighty limbs invest,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she threw her tasselled aegis</p>
    <p class=l>jove’s cuirass blazes on her ample breast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about her shoulders, wreathed round with rout as with a fringe,</p>
    <p class=l>deck’d in sad triumph for the mournful field,<br />o’er her broad shoulders hangs his horrid shield,<br />dire, black, tremendous!<br />round the margin roll’d,<br />a fringe of serpents hissing guards the gold:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and on it were strife, and strength, and panic whose blood runs</p>
    <p class=l>here all the terrors of grim war appear,<br />here rages force, here tremble flight and fear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cold; moreover there was the head of the dread monster gorgon,</p>
    <p class=l>here storm’d contention, and here fury frown’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grim and awful to behold, portent of aegis-bearing jove.</p>
    <p class=l>and the dire orb portentous gorgon crown’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on her</p>
    <p class=l>the massy golden helm she next assumes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>head she set her helmet of gold, with four plumes, and coming to</p>
    <p class=l>that dreadful nods with four o’ershading plumes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a peak both in front and behind—decked with the emblems of a</p>
    <p class=l>so vast, the broad circumference contains</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hundred cities; then she stepped into her flaming chariot and</p>
    <p class=l>a hundred armies on a hundred plains.<br />the goddess thus the imperial car ascends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grasped the spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, with which she</p>
    <p class=l>shook by her arm the mighty javelin bends,<br />ponderous and huge; that when her fury burns,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her.</p>
    <p class=l>proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o’erturns.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>juno lashed</p>
    <p class=l>swift at the scourge the ethereal coursers fly,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the horses on, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew open</p>
    <p class=l>while the smooth chariot cuts the liquid sky.<br />heaven’s gates spontaneous open to the powers,[155]<br />heaven’s golden gates, kept by the winged hours;[156]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of their own accord—gates over which the hours preside, in whose</p>
    <p class=l>commission’d in alternate watch they stand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hands are heaven and olympus, either to open the dense cloud that</p>
    <p class=l>the sun’s bright portals and the skies command,<br />involve in clouds the eternal gates of day,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hides them, or to close it.</p>
    <p class=l>or the dark barrier roll with ease away.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through these the goddesses drove</p>
    <p class=l>the sounding hinges ring, on either side</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their obedient steeds, and found the son of saturn sitting all</p>
    <p class=l>the gloomy volumes, pierced with light, divide.<br />the chariot mounts, where deep in ambient skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alone on the topmost ridges of olympus.</p>
    <p class=l>confused, olympus’ hundred heads arise;<br />where far apart the thunderer fills his throne,<br />o’er all the gods superior and alone.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there juno stayed her</p>
    <p class=l>there with her snowy hand the queen restrains</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses, and spoke to jove the son of saturn, lord of all.</p>
    <p class=l>the fiery steeds, and thus to jove complains:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“father</p>
    <p class=l>“o sire!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove,” said she, “are you not angry with mars for these high</p>
    <p class=l>can no resentment touch thy soul?<br />can mars rebel, and does no thunder roll?<br />what lawless rage on yon forbidden plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>doings?</p>
    <p class=l>what rash destruction!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>how great and goodly a host of the achaeans he has</p>
    <p class=l>and what heroes slain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>destroyed to my great grief, and without either right or reason,</p>
    <p class=l>venus, and phœbus with the dreadful bow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while the cyprian and apollo are enjoying it all at their ease</p>
    <p class=l>smile on the slaughter, and enjoy my woe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and setting this unrighteous madman on to do further mischief.</p>
    <p class=l>mad, furious power!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i</p>
    <p class=l>whose unrelenting mind</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hope, father jove, that you will not be angry if i hit mars hard,</p>
    <p class=l>no god can govern, and no justice bind.<br />say, mighty father!<br />shall we scourge this pride,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and chase him out of the battle.</p>
    <p class=l>and drive from fight the impetuous homicide?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and jove answered, “set minerva on to him, for she punishes him</p>
    <p class=l>to whom assenting, thus the thunderer said:<br />“go!<br />and the great minerva be thy aid.<br />to tame the monster-god minerva knows,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>more often than any one else does.</p>
    <p class=l>and oft afflicts his brutal breast with woes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>juno did as he had said.</p>
    <p class=l>he said; saturnia, ardent to obey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she lashed her horses, and they flew</p>
    <p class=l>lash’d her white steeds along the aerial way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forward nothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky.</p>
    <p class=l>swift down the steep of heaven the chariot rolls,<br />between the expanded earth and starry poles.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as far as a</p>
    <p class=l>far as a shepherd, from some point on high,[157]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>man can see when he looks out upon the sea from some high beacon,</p>
    <p class=l>o’er the wide main extends his boundless eye,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so far can the loud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a</p>
    <p class=l>through such a space of air, with thundering sound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>single bound.</p>
    <p class=l>at every leap the immortal coursers bound</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they reached troy and the place where its two</p>
    <p class=l>troy now they reach’d and touch’d those banks divine,<br />where silver simois and scamander join.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flowing streams simois and scamander meet, there juno stayed them</p>
    <p class=l>there juno stopp’d, and (her fair steeds unloosed)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and took them from the chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>of air condensed a vapour circumfused:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she hid them in a thick cloud,</p>
    <p class=l>for these, impregnate with celestial dew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and simois made ambrosia spring up for them to eat; the two</p>
    <p class=l>on simois’ brink ambrosial herbage grew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>goddesses then went on, flying like turtledoves in their<br />eagerness to help the argives.</p>
    <p class=l>thence to relieve the fainting argive throng,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they came to the part where</p>
    <p class=l>smooth as the sailing doves they glide along.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the bravest and most in number were gathered about mighty diomed,</p>
    <p class=l>the best and bravest of the grecian band</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and</p>
    <p class=l>(a warlike circle) round tydides stand.<br />such was their look as lions bathed in blood,<br />or foaming boars, the terror of the wood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>endurance, there juno stood still and raised a shout like that of</p>
    <p class=l>heaven’s empress mingles with the mortal crowd,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brazen-voiced stentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men</p>
    <p class=l>and shouts, in stentor’s sounding voice, aloud;<br />stentor the strong, endued with brazen lungs,[158]<br />whose throats surpass’d the force of fifty tongues.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>together.</p>
    <p class=l>“inglorious argives!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“argives,” she cried; “shame on cowardly creatures,</p>
    <p class=l>to your race a shame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brave in semblance only; as long as achilles was fighting, if his</p>
    <p class=l>and only men in figure and in name!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear was so deadly that the trojans dared not show themselves</p>
    <p class=l>once from the walls your timorous foes engaged,<br />while fierce in war divine achilles raged;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>outside the dardanian gates, but now they sally far from the city</p>
    <p class=l>now issuing fearless they possess the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and fight even at your ships.</p>
    <p class=l>now win the shores, and scarce the seas remain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words she put heart and soul into them all, while</p>
    <p class=l>her speech new fury to their hearts convey’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva sprang to the side of the son of tydeus, whom she found</p>
    <p class=l>while near tydides stood the athenian maid;<br />the king beside his panting steeds she found,<br />o’erspent with toil reposing on the ground;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>near his chariot and horses, cooling the wound that pandarus had</p>
    <p class=l>to cool his glowing wound he sat apart,<br />(the wound inflicted by the lycian dart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>given him.</p>
    <p class=l>)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the sweat caused by the hand that bore the weight</p>
    <p class=l>large drops of sweat from all his limbs descend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of his shield irritated the hurt: his arm was weary with pain,</p>
    <p class=l>beneath his ponderous shield his sinews bend,<br />whose ample belt, that o’er his shoulder lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and he was lifting up the strap to wipe away the blood.</p>
    <p class=l>he eased; and wash’d the clotted gore away.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>the goddess leaning o’er the bending yoke,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>goddess laid her hand on the yoke of his horses and said, “the</p>
    <p class=l>beside his coursers, thus her silence broke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of tydeus is not such another as his father.</p>
    <p class=l>“degenerate prince!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tydeus was a</p>
    <p class=l>and not of tydeus’ kind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>little man, but he could fight, and rushed madly into the fray</p>
    <p class=l>whose little body lodged a mighty mind;<br />foremost he press’d in glorious toils to share,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even when i told him not to do so.</p>
    <p class=l>and scarce refrain’d when i forbade the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he went all unattended as</p>
    <p class=l>alone, unguarded, once he dared to go,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>envoy to the city of thebes among the cadmeans, i bade him feast<br />in their houses and be at peace; but with that high spirit which</p>

    <p class=r>ablerus fell by the spear of nestor’s son antilochus, and</p>
    <p class=l>by teucer’s shaft brave aretaon bled,<br />and nestor’s son laid stern ablerus dead;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon, king of men, killed elatus who dwelt in pedasus by the</p>
    <p class=l>great agamemnon, leader of the brave,<br />the mortal wound of rich elatus gave,<br />who held in pedasus his proud abode,[162]</p>

    <p class=r>leitus killed phylacus as he was</p>
    <p class=l>melanthius by eurypylus was slain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flying, and eurypylus slew melanthus.</p>
    <p class=l>and phylacus from leitus flies in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then menelaus of the loud war-cry took adrestus alive, for his</p>
    <p class=l>unbless’d adrastus next at mercy lies<br />beneath the spartan spear, a living prize.<br />scared with the din and tumult of the fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses ran into a tamarisk bush, as they were flying wildly over</p>
    <p class=l>his headlong steeds, precipitate in flight,<br />rush’d on a tamarisk’s strong trunk, and broke</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the plain, and broke the pole from the car; they went on towards</p>
    <p class=l>the shatter’d chariot from the crooked yoke;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the city along with the others in full flight, but adrestus</p>
    <p class=l>wide o’er the field, resistless as the wind,<br />for troy they fly, and leave their lord behind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rolled out, and fell in the dust flat on his face by the wheel of</p>
    <p class=l>prone on his face he sinks beside the wheel:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his chariot; menelaus came up to him spear in hand, but adrestus</p>
    <p class=l>atrides o’er him shakes his vengeful steel;<br />the fallen chief in suppliant posture press’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>caught him by the knees begging for his life.</p>
    <p class=l>the victor’s knees, and thus his prayer address’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“take me alive,” he<br />cried, “son of atreus, and you shall have a full ransom for me:</p>
    <p class=l>“o spare my youth, and for the life i owe</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my father is rich and has much treasure of gold, bronze, and</p>
    <p class=l>large gifts of price my father shall bestow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wrought iron laid by in his house.</p>
    <p class=l>when fame shall tell, that, not in battle slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from this store he will give</p>
    <p class=l>thy hollow ships his captive son detain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you a large ransom should he hear of my being alive and at the</p>
    <p class=l>rich heaps of brass shall in thy tent be told,[163]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>and steel well-temper’d, and persuasive gold.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he plead, and menelaus was for yielding and giving him</p>
    <p class=l>he said: compassion touch’d the hero’s heart<br />he stood, suspended with the lifted dart:<br />as pity pleaded for his vanquish’d prize,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to a squire to take to the ships of the achaeans, but agamemnon</p>
    <p class=l>stern agamemnon swift to vengeance flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came running up to him and rebuked him.</p>
    <p class=l>and, furious, thus: “oh impotent of mind!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my good menelaus,” said</p>
    <p class=l>[164]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he, “this is no time for giving quarter.</p>
    <p class=l>shall these, shall these atrides’ mercy find?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>has, then, your house</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fared so well at the hands of the trojans?</p>
    <p class=l>and well her natives merit at thy hand!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us not spare a</p>
    <p class=l>not one of all the race, nor sex, nor age,<br />shall save a trojan from our boundless rage:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>single one of them—not even the child unborn and in its mother’s</p>

    <p class=l>her babes, her infants at the breast, shall fall;[165]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>perish, unheeded and forgotten.</p>
    <p class=l>a dreadful lesson of exampled fate,<br />to warn the nations, and to curb the great!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for his<br />words were just.</p>
    <p class=l>the monarch spoke; the words, with warmth address’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus, therefore, thrust adrestus from him,</p>
    <p class=l>to rigid justice steel’d his brother’s breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whereon king agamemnon struck him in the flank, and he fell: then</p>
    <p class=l>fierce from his knees the hapless chief he thrust;<br />the monarch’s javelin stretch’d him in the dust,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of atreus planted his foot upon his breast to draw his</p>
    <p class=l>then pressing with his foot his panting heart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear from the body.</p>
    <p class=l>forth from the slain he tugg’d the reeking dart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile nestor shouted to the argives, saying, “my friends,</p>
    <p class=l>old nestor saw, and roused the warrior’s rage;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>danaan warriors, servants of mars, let no man lag that he may</p>
    <p class=l>“thus, heroes!<br />thus the vigorous combat wage;<br />no son of mars descend, for servile gains,</p>

    <p class=r>spoil the dead, and bring back much booty to the ships.<br />let us</p>
    <p class=l>to touch the booty, while a foe remains.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>kill as many as we can; the bodies will lie upon the plain, and</p>
    <p class=l>behold yon glittering host, your future spoil!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you can despoil them later at your leisure.</p>
    <p class=l>first gain the conquest, then reward the toil.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he put heart and soul into them all.<br />and now the</p>
    <p class=l>and now had greece eternal fame acquired,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans would have been routed and driven back into ilius, had</p>
    <p class=l>and frighted troy within her walls, retired,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not priam’s son helenus, wisest of augurs, said to hector and</p>
    <p class=l>had not sage helenus her state redress’d,<br />taught by the gods that moved his sacred breast.<br />where hector stood, with great æneas join’d,<br />the seer reveal’d the counsels of his mind:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas, “hector and aeneas, you two are the mainstays of the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>themselves into the arms of their wives, to the great joy of our</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foes.</p>
    <p class=l>the sport and insult of the hostile train.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then, when you have put heart into all our companies, we</p>
    <p class=l>when your commands have hearten’d every band,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will stand firm here and fight the danaans however hard they</p>
    <p class=l>ourselves, here fix’d, will make the dangerous stand;<br />press’d as we are, and sore of former fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>press us, for there is nothing else to be done.</p>
    <p class=l>these straits demand our last remains of might.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile do you,</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile thou, hector, to the town retire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector, go to the city and tell our mother what is happening.</p>
    <p class=l>and teach our mother what the gods require:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tell her to bid the matrons gather at the temple of minerva in</p>
    <p class=l>direct the queen to lead the assembled train<br />of troy’s chief matrons to minerva’s fane;[166]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the acropolis; let her then take her key and open the doors of</p>
    <p class=l>unbar the sacred gates, and seek the power,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sacred building; there, upon the knees of minerva, let her</p>
    <p class=l>with offer’d vows, in ilion’s topmost tower.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lay the largest, fairest robe she has in her house—the one she</p>
    <p class=l>the largest mantle her rich wardrobes hold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sets most store by; let her, moreover, promise to sacrifice</p>
    <p class=l>most prized for art, and labour’d o’er with gold,<br />before the goddess’ honour’d knees be spread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>twelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the</p>

    <p class=r>i hold him mightiest</p>
    <p class=l>that mows whole troops, and makes all troy retire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of them all; we did not fear even their great champion achilles,</p>
    <p class=l>not thus achilles taught our hosts to dread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of a goddess though he be, as we do this man: his rage is</p>
    <p class=l>sprung though he was from more than mortal bed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beyond all bounds, and there is none can vie with him in</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector did as his brother bade him.</p>
    <p class=l>hector obedient heard: and, with a bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he sprang from his chariot,</p>
    <p class=l>leap’d from his trembling chariot to the ground;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and went about everywhere among the host, brandishing his spears,</p>
    <p class=l>through all his host inspiring force he flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>urging the men on to fight, and raising the dread cry of battle.</p>
    <p class=l>and bids the thunder of the battle rise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon they rallied and again faced the achaeans, who gave</p>
    <p class=l>with rage recruited the bold trojans glow,<br />and turn the tide of conflict on the foe:<br />fierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears;<br />all greece recedes, and ’midst her triumphs fears;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ground and ceased their murderous onset, for they deemed that</p>
    <p class=l>some god, they thought, who ruled the fate of wars,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some one of the immortals had come down from starry heaven to</p>
    <p class=l>shot down avenging from the vault of stars.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>help the trojans, so strangely had they rallied.</p>
    <p class=l>then thus aloud: “ye dauntless dardans, hear!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and hector</p>
    <p class=l>and you whom distant nations send to war!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shouted to the trojans, “trojans and allies, be men, my friends,</p>
    <p class=l>be mindful of the strength your fathers bore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and fight with might and main, while i go to ilius and tell the</p>
    <p class=l>be still yourselves, and hector asks no more.<br />one hour demands me in the trojan wall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>old men of our council and our wives to pray to the gods and vow</p>
    <p class=l>to bid our altars flame, and victims fall:<br />nor shall, i trust, the matrons’ holy train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hecatombs in their honour.</p>
    <p class=l>and reverend elders, seek the gods in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this he went his way, and the black rim of hide that went</p>
    <p class=l>this said, with ample strides the hero pass’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>round his shield beat against his neck and his ancles.</p>
    <p class=l>the shield’s large orb behind his shoulder cast,<br />his neck o’ershading, to his ankle hung;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then glaucus son of hippolochus, and the son of tydeus went into</p>
    <p class=l>and as he march’d the brazen buckler rung.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the open space between the hosts to fight in single combat.</p>
    <p class=l>now paused the battle (godlike hector gone),[167]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when</p>
    <p class=l>where daring glaucus and great tydeus’ son</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were close up to one another diomed of the loud war-cry was</p>
    <p class=l>between both armies met: the chiefs from far<br />observed each other, and had mark’d for war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the first to speak.</p>
    <p class=l>near as they drew, tydides thus began:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“who, my good sir,” said he, “who are you<br />among men?</p>
    <p class=l>“what art thou, boldest of the race of man?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have never seen you in battle until now, but you are</p>
    <p class=l>our eyes till now that aspect ne’er beheld,<br />where fame is reap’d amid the embattled field;<br />yet far before the troops thou dar’st appear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>daring beyond all others if you abide my onset.</p>
    <p class=l>and meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>woe to those</p>
    <p class=l>unhappy they, and born of luckless sires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fathers whose sons face my might.</p>
    <p class=l>who tempt our fury when minerva fires!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if, however, you are one of the</p>
    <p class=l>but if from heaven, celestial, thou descend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>immortals and have come down from heaven, i will not fight you;</p>
    <p class=l>know with immortals we no more contend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for even valiant lycurgus, son of dryas, did not live long when</p>
    <p class=l>not long lycurgus view’d the golden light,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he took to fighting with the gods.</p>
    <p class=l>that daring man who mix’d with gods in fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he it was that drove the</p>
    <p class=l>bacchus, and bacchus’ votaries, he drove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nursing women who were in charge of frenzied bacchus through the</p>
    <p class=l>with brandish’d steel, from nyssa’s sacred grove:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>land of nysa, and they flung their thyrsi on the ground as</p>
    <p class=l>their consecrated spears lay scatter’d round,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>murderous lycurgus beat them with his oxgoad.</p>
    <p class=l>with curling vines and twisted ivy bound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bacchus himself<br />plunged terror-stricken into the sea, and thetis took him to her<br />bosom to comfort him, for he was scared by the fury with which</p>
    <p class=l>while bacchus headlong sought the briny flood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the man reviled him.</p>
    <p class=l>and thetis’ arms received the trembling god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon the gods who live at ease were angry</p>
    <p class=l>nor fail’d the crime the immortals’ wrath to move;<br />(the immortals bless’d with endless ease above;)<br />deprived of sight by their avenging doom,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with lycurgus and the son of saturn struck him blind, nor did he</p>
    <p class=l>cheerless he breathed, and wander’d in the gloom,<br />then sunk unpitied to the dire abodes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>live much longer after he had become hateful to the immortals.</p>
    <p class=l>a wretch accursed, and hated by the gods!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore i will not fight with the blessed gods; but if you are</p>
    <p class=l>i brave not heaven: but if the fruits of earth</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of them that eat the fruit of the ground, draw near and meet your</p>
    <p class=l>sustain thy life, and human be thy birth,<br />bold as thou art, too prodigal of breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>doom.</p>
    <p class=l>approach, and enter the dark gates of death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and the son of hippolochus answered, “son of tydeus, why ask me</p>
    <p class=l>“what, or from whence i am, or who my sire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of my lineage?</p>
    <p class=l>(replied the chief,) can tydeus’ son inquire?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men come and go as leaves year by year upon the<br />trees.</p>
    <p class=l>like leaves on trees the race of man is found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>those of autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when</p>
    <p class=l>now green in youth, now withering on the ground;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spring returns the forest buds forth with fresh vines.</p>
    <p class=l>another race the following spring supplies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so is</p>
    <p class=l>they fall successive, and successive rise:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it with the generations of mankind, the new spring up as the old</p>
    <p class=l>so generations in their course decay;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are passing away.</p>
    <p class=l>so flourish these, when those are pass’d away.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if, then, you would learn my descent, it is one</p>
    <p class=l>but if thou still persist to search my birth,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that is well known to many.</p>
    <p class=l>then hear a tale that fills the spacious earth.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there is a city in the heart of</p>
    <p class=l>“a city stands on argos’ utmost bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>argos, pasture land of horses, called ephyra, where sisyphus</p>
    <p class=l>(argos the fair, for warlike steeds renown’d,)<br />æolian sisyphus, with wisdom bless’d,</p>

    <p class=r>lived, who was the craftiest of all mankind.</p>
    <p class=l>in ancient time the happy wall possess’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was the son of<br />aeolus, and had a son named glaucus, who was father to</p>

    <p class=r>bellerophon, whom heaven endowed with the most surpassing</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i do not remember tydeus, for he was taken from us</p>

    <p class=r>sons of priam slept, each with his wedded wife.<br />opposite these,<br />on the other side the courtyard, there were twelve upper rooms</p>

    <p class=l>scared at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest.</p>

    <p class=r>his father and mother laughed to see him, but hector took</p>

    <p class=r>say of him as he comes from battle, ‘the son is far better than</p>

    <p class=r>took him to her own soft bosom, smiling through her tears.</p>
    <p class=l>soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,<br />hush’d to repose, and with a smile survey’d.<br />the troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,<br />she mingled with a smile a tender tear.</p>

    <p class=r>her fondly, saying, “my own wife, do not take these things too</p>
    <p class=l>and dried the falling drops, and thus pursued:</p>

    <p class=r>shoulder, as he was springing on to his chariot behind his fleet</p>
    <p class=l>fix’d in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mares; so he fell to earth from the car, and there was no life</p>
    <p class=l>headlong he tumbles: his slack nerves unbound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>left in him.</p>
    <p class=l>drop the cold useless members on the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when, therefore, minerva saw these men making havoc of the</p>
    <p class=l>when now minerva saw her argives slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>argives, she darted down to ilius from the summits of olympus,</p>
    <p class=l>from vast olympus to the gleaming plain<br />fierce she descends: apollo marked her flight,<br />nor shot less swift from ilion’s towery height.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and apollo, who was looking on from pergamus, went out to meet</p>
    <p class=l>radiant they met, beneath the beechen shade;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her; for he wanted the trojans to be victorious.<br />the pair met by</p>
    <p class=l>when thus apollo to the blue-eyed maid:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the oak tree, and king apollo son of jove was first to speak.<br />“what would you have,” said he, “daughter of great jove, that</p>
    <p class=l>“what cause, o daughter of almighty jove!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your proud spirit has sent you hither from olympus?</p>
    <p class=l>thus wings thy progress from the realms above?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have you no<br />pity upon the trojans, and would you incline the scales of</p>
    <p class=l>once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>victory in favour of the danaans?</p>
    <p class=l>to give to greece the long divided day?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let me persuade you—for it will</p>
    <p class=l>too much has troy already felt thy hate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be better thus—stay the combat for to-day, but let them renew the</p>
    <p class=l>now breathe thy rage, and hush the stern debate;<br />this day, the business of the field suspend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight hereafter till they compass the doom of ilius, since you</p>
    <p class=l>war soon shall kindle, and great ilion bend;<br />since vengeful goddesses confederate join</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>goddesses have made up your minds to destroy the city.</p>
    <p class=l>to raze her walls, though built by hands divine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and minerva answered, “so be it, far-darter; it was in this mind</p>
    <p class=l>to whom the progeny of jove replies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that i came down from olympus to the trojans and achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>“i left, for this, the council of the skies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tell</p>
    <p class=l>but who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me, then, how do you propose to end this present fighting?</p>
    <p class=l>what art shall calm the furious sons of war?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo, son of jove, replied, “let us incite great hector to</p>
    <p class=l>to her the god: “great hector’s soul incite</p>

    <p class=r>challenge some one of the danaans in single combat; on this the</p>
    <p class=l>to dare the boldest greek to single fight,<br />till greece, provoked, from all her numbers show</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans will be shamed into finding a man who will fight him.</p>
    <p class=l>a warrior worthy to be hector’s foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva assented, and helenus son of priam divined the counsel of</p>
    <p class=l>at this agreed, the heavenly powers withdrew;<br />sage helenus their secret counsels knew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the gods; he therefore went up to hector and said, “hector son of</p>
    <p class=l>hector, inspired, he sought: to him address’d,<br />thus told the dictates of his sacred breast:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam, peer of gods in counsel, i am your brother, let me then</p>
    <p class=l>“o son of priam!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>persuade you.</p>
    <p class=l>let thy faithful ear<br />receive my words: thy friend and brother hear!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bid the other trojans and achaeans all of them take</p>
    <p class=l>go forth persuasive, and a while engage</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their seats, and challenge the best man among the achaeans to</p>
    <p class=l>the warring nations to suspend their rage;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meet you in single combat.</p>
    <p class=l>then dare the boldest of the hostile train</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have heard the voice of the</p>
    <p class=l>to mortal combat on the listed plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ever-living gods, and the hour of your doom is not yet come.</p>
    <p class=l>for not this day shall end thy glorious date;<br />the gods have spoke it, and their voice is fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among the</p>
    <p class=l>he said: the warrior heard the word with joy;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans, grasping his spear by the middle to hold them back, and</p>
    <p class=l>then with his spear restrain’d the youth of troy,<br />held by the midst athwart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they all sat down.</p>
    <p class=l>on either hand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon also bade the achaeans be seated.</p>
    <p class=l>the squadrons part; the expecting trojans stand;<br />great agamemnon bids the greeks forbear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but minerva and apollo, in the likeness of vultures, perched on</p>
    <p class=l>they breathe, and hush the tumult of the war.<br />the athenian maid,[178] and glorious god of day,<br />with silent joy the settling hosts survey:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father jove’s high oak tree, proud of their men; and the ranks</p>
    <p class=l>in form of vultures, on the beech’s height</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sat close ranged together, bristling with shield and helmet and</p>
    <p class=l>they sit conceal’d, and wait the future fight.<br />the thronging troops obscure the dusky fields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear.</p>
    <p class=l>horrid with bristling spears, and gleaming shields.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when the rising west wind furs the face of the sea and</p>
    <p class=l>as when a general darkness veils the main,<br />(soft zephyr curling the wide wat’ry plain,)<br />the waves scarce heave, the face of ocean sleeps,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the waters grow dark beneath it, so sat the companies of trojans</p>
    <p class=l>and a still horror saddens all the deeps;<br />thus in thick orders settling wide around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and achaeans upon the plain.</p>
    <p class=l>at length composed they sit, and shade the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and hector spoke thus:—</p>
    <p class=l>great hector first amidst both armies broke<br />the solemn silence, and their powers bespoke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“hear me, trojans and achaeans, that i may speak even as i am</p>
    <p class=l>“hear, all ye trojan, all ye grecian bands,<br />what my soul prompts, and what some god commands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minded; jove on his high throne has brought our oaths and</p>
    <p class=l>great jove, averse our warfare to compose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>covenants to nothing, and foreshadows ill for both of us, till</p>
    <p class=l>o’erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes;<br />war with a fiercer tide once more returns,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you either take the towers of troy, or are yourselves vanquished</p>
    <p class=l>till ilion falls, or till yon navy burns.<br />you then, o princes of the greeks!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at your ships.</p>
    <p class=l>appear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the princes of the achaeans are here present in</p>
    <p class=l>’tis hector speaks, and calls the gods to hear:<br />from all your troops select the boldest knight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the midst of you; let him, then, that will fight me stand forward<br />as your champion against hector.</p>
    <p class=l>and him, the boldest, hector dares to fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus i say, and may jove be<br />witness between us.<br />if your champion slay me, let him strip me of</p>
    <p class=l>here if i fall, by chance of battle slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my armour and take it to your ships, but let him send my body</p>
    <p class=l>be his my spoil, and his these arms remain;<br />but let my body, to my friends return’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>home that the trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire</p>
    <p class=l>by trojan hands and trojan flames be burn’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when i am dead.<br />in like manner, if apollo vouchsafe me glory and</p>
    <p class=l>and if apollo, in whose aid i trust,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i slay your champion, i will strip him of his armour and take it</p>
    <p class=l>shall stretch your daring champion in the dust;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to the city of ilius, where i will hang it in the temple of</p>
    <p class=l>if mine the glory to despoil the foe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo, but i will give up his body, that the achaeans may bury</p>
    <p class=l>on phœbus’ temple i’ll his arms bestow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him at their ships, and then build him a mound by the wide waters</p>
    <p class=l>the breathless carcase to your navy sent,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the hellespont.</p>
    <p class=l>greece on the shore shall raise a monument;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then will one say hereafter as he sails his</p>
    <p class=l>which when some future mariner surveys,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ship over the sea, ‘this is the monument of one who died long</p>
    <p class=l>wash’d by broad hellespont’s resounding seas,<br />thus shall he say, ‘a valiant greek lies there,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>since a champion who was slain by mighty hector.</p>
    <p class=l>by hector slain, the mighty man of war,’</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>’ thus will one</p>
    <p class=l>the stone shall tell your vanquish’d hero’s name</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>say, and my fame shall not be lost.</p>
    <p class=l>and distant ages learn the victor’s fame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to</p>
    <p class=l>this fierce defiance greece astonish’d heard,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>decline the challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last</p>
    <p class=l>blush’d to refuse, and to accept it fear’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus rose and rebuked them, for he was angry.</p>
    <p class=l>stern menelaus first the silence broke,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“alas,” he</p>
    <p class=l>and, inly groaning, thus opprobrious spoke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cried, “vain braggarts, women forsooth not men, double-dyed</p>
    <p class=l>“women of greece!<br />o scandal of your race,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>indeed will be the stain upon us if no man of the danaans will</p>
    <p class=l>whose coward souls your manly form disgrace,<br />how great the shame, when every age shall know<br />that not a grecian met this noble foe!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now face hector.</p>
    <p class=l>go then!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may you be turned every man of you into earth</p>
    <p class=l>resolve to earth, from whence ye grew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious in your places.</p>
    <p class=l>a heartless, spiritless, inglorious crew!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i</p>
    <p class=l>be what ye seem, unanimated clay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will myself go out against this man, but the upshot of the fight</p>
    <p class=l>myself will dare the danger of the day;<br />’tis man’s bold task the generous strife to try,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will be from on high in the hands of the immortal gods.</p>
    <p class=l>but in the hands of god is victory.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he put on his armour; and then, o menelaus, your</p>
    <p class=l>these words scarce spoke, with generous ardour press’d,<br />his manly limbs in azure arms he dress’d.<br />that day, atrides!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>life would have come to an end at the hands of hands of hector,</p>
    <p class=l>a superior hand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for he was far better the man, had not the princes of the</p>
    <p class=l>had stretch’d thee breathless on the hostile strand;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans sprung upon you and checked you.</p>
    <p class=l>but all at once, thy fury to compose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>king agamemnon caught</p>
    <p class=l>the kings of greece, an awful band, arose;<br />even he their chief, great agamemnon, press’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him by the right hand and said, “menelaus, you are mad; a truce</p>
    <p class=l>thy daring hand, and this advice address’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to this folly.</p>
    <p class=l>“whither, o menelaus!<br />wouldst thou run,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be patient in spite of passion, do not think of</p>
    <p class=l>and tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun?<br />grieved though thou art, forbear the rash design;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fighting a man so much stronger than yourself as hector son of</p>
    <p class=l>great hector’s arm is mightier far than thine:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam, who is feared by many another as well as you.<br />even<br />achilles, who is far more doughty than you are, shrank from</p>
    <p class=l>even fierce achilles learn’d its force to fear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meeting him in battle.</p>
    <p class=l>and trembling met this dreadful son of war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sit down your own people, and the achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>sit thou secure, amidst thy social band;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will send some other champion to fight hector; fearless and fond</p>
    <p class=l>greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand.<br />the mightiest warrior of the achaian name,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of battle though he be, i ween his knees will bend gladly under</p>
    <p class=l>though bold and burning with desire of fame,<br />content the doubtful honour might forego,</p>

    <p class=r>him if he comes out alive from the hurly-burly of this fight.</p>
    <p class=l>so great the danger, and so brave the foe.</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother,</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and turn’d his brother’s vengeful mind;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whereon his squires gladly stripped the armour from off his</p>
    <p class=l>he stoop’d to reason, and his rage resign’d,<br />no longer bent to rush on certain harms;<br />his joyful friends unbrace his azure arms.<br />he from whose lips divine persuasion flows,<br />grave nestor, then, in graceful act arose;<br />thus to the kings he spoke: “what grief, what shame</p>

    <p class=r>shoulders.</p>
    <p class=l>attend on greece, and all the grecian name!</p>

    <p class=r>then nestor rose and spoke, “of a truth,” said he,</p>
    <p class=l>how shall, alas!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“the achaean land is fallen upon evil times.</p>

    <p class=r>mace-man,’ because he fought neither with bow nor spear, but<br />broke the battalions of the foe with his iron mace.</p>
    <p class=l>by the huge, knotted, iron mace he bore;</p>

    <p class=l>no lance he shook, nor bent the twanging bow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>killed him, not in fair fight, but by entrapping him in a narrow</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>way where his mace served him in no stead; for lycurgus was too</p>

    <p class=l>deep in a winding way his breast assailed,</p>

    <p class=l>and dared the trial of the strongest hands;<br />nor could the strongest hands his fury stay:<br />all saw, and fear’d, his huge tempestuous sway</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me fight him though none other would venture; i was the youngest</p>
    <p class=l>till i, the youngest of the host, appear’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>man of them all; but when i fought him minerva vouchsafed me</p>
    <p class=l>and, youngest, met whom all our army fear’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>victory.<br />he was the biggest and strongest man that ever i killed,</p>
    <p class=l>i fought the chief: my arms minerva crown’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and covered much ground as he lay sprawling upon the earth.</p>
    <p class=l>prone fell the giant o’er a length of ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would<br />that i were still young and strong as i then was, for the son of</p>
    <p class=l>what then i was, o were your nestor now!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam would then soon find one who would face him.</p>
    <p class=l>not hector’s self should want an equal foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but you,</p>
    <p class=l>but, warriors, you that youthful vigour boast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foremost among the whole host though you be, have none of you any</p>
    <p class=l>the flower of greece, the examples of our host,<br />sprung from such fathers, who such numbers sway,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stomach for fighting hector.</p>
    <p class=l>can you stand trembling, and desert the day?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men started</p>
    <p class=l>his warm reproofs the listening kings inflame;<br />and nine, the noblest of the grecian name,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to their feet.</p>
    <p class=l>up-started fierce: but far before the rest</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foremost of all uprose king agamemnon, and after</p>
    <p class=l>the king of men advanced his dauntless breast:<br />then bold tydides, great in arms, appear’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him brave diomed the son of tydeus.</p>
    <p class=l>and next his bulk gigantic ajax rear’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>next were the two ajaxes, men</p>
    <p class=l>oïleus follow’d; idomen was there,[180]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>clothed in valour as with a garment, and then idomeneus, and</p>
    <p class=l>and merion, dreadful as the god of war:<br />with these eurypylus and thoas stand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones his brother in arms.</p>
    <p class=l>and wise ulysses closed the daring band.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after these eurypylus son of</p>
    <p class=l>all these, alike inspired with noble rage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>euaemon, thoas the son of andraemon, and ulysses also rose.</p>
    <p class=l>demand the fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then</p>
    <p class=l>to whom the pylian sage:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nestor knight of gerene again spoke, saying: “cast lots among you</p>
    <p class=l>“lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to see who shall be chosen.</p>
    <p class=l>what chief shall combat, let the gods decide.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if he come alive out of this fight he</p>
    <p class=l>whom heaven shall choose, be his the chance to raise</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will have done good service alike to his own soul and to the</p>
    <p class=l>his country’s fame, his own immortal praise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had</p>
    <p class=l>the lots produced, each hero signs his own:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thrown it into the helmet of agamemnon son of atreus, the people</p>
    <p class=l>then in the general’s helm the fates are thrown,[181]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lifted their hands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as</p>
    <p class=l>the people pray, with lifted eyes and hands,<br />and vows like these ascend from all the bands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he looked into the vault of heaven, “father jove, grant that the</p>
    <p class=l>“grant, thou almighty!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lot fall on ajax, or on the son of tydeus, or upon the king of</p>
    <p class=l>in whose hand is fate,<br />a worthy champion for the grecian state:<br />this task let ajax or tydides prove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rich mycene himself.</p>
    <p class=l>or he, the king of kings, beloved by jove.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as they were speaking, nestor knight of gerene shook the helmet,</p>
    <p class=l>old nestor shook the casque.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and from it there fell the very lot which they wanted—the lot of<br />ajax.</p>
    <p class=l>by heaven inspired,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the herald bore it about and showed it to all the</p>
    <p class=l>leap’d forth the lot, of every greek desired.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chieftains of the achaeans, going from left to right; but they</p>
    <p class=l>this from the right to left the herald bears,<br />held out in order to the grecian peers;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>none of them owned it.</p>
    <p class=l>each to his rival yields the mark unknown,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when, however, in due course he reached</p>
    <p class=l>till godlike ajax finds the lot his own;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the man who had written upon it and had put it into the helmet,</p>
    <p class=l>surveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brave ajax held out his hand, and the herald gave him the lot.</p>
    <p class=l>then casts before him, and with transport cries:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when ajax saw his mark he knew it and was glad; he threw it to</p>
    <p class=l>“warriors!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ground and said, “my friends, the lot is mine, and i rejoice,</p>
    <p class=l>i claim the lot, and arm with joy;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for i shall vanquish hector.</p>
    <p class=l>be mine the conquest of this chief of troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will put on my armour; meanwhile,</p>
    <p class=l>now while my brightest arms my limbs invest,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pray to king jove in silence among yourselves that the trojans</p>
    <p class=l>to saturn’s son be all your vows address’d:<br />but pray in secret, lest the foes should hear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may not hear you—or aloud if you will, for we fear no man.</p>
    <p class=l>and deem your prayers the mean effect of fear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>none</p>
    <p class=l>said i in secret?<br />no, your vows declare</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for i was born</p>
    <p class=l>in such a voice as fills the earth and air,<br />lives there a chief whom ajax ought to dread?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and bred in salamis, and can hold my own in all things.</p>
    <p class=l>ajax, in all the toils of battle bred!<br />from warlike salamis i drew my birth,<br />and, born to combats, fear no force on earth.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”<br />he said.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this they fell praying to king jove the son of saturn, and</p>
    <p class=l>the troops with elevated eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus would one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven,</p>
    <p class=l>implore the god whose thunder rends the skies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“father jove that rulest from ida, most glorious in power,</p>
    <p class=l>“o father of mankind, superior lord!<br />on lofty ida’s holy hill adored:<br />who in the highest heaven hast fix’d thy throne,<br />supreme of gods!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vouchsafe victory to ajax, and let him win great glory: but if</p>
    <p class=l>unbounded and alone:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you wish well to hector also and would protect him, grant to each</p>
    <p class=l>grant thou, that telamon may bear away<br />the praise and conquest of this doubtful day;<br />or, if illustrious hector be thy care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of them equal fame and prowess.</p>
    <p class=l>that both may claim it, and that both may share.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus they prayed, and ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming</p>
    <p class=l>now ajax braced his dazzling armour on;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bronze.</p>
    <p class=l>sheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrous</p>
    <p class=l>he moves to combat with majestic pace;<br />so stalks in arms the grisly god of thrace,[182]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mars when he takes part among men whom jove has set fighting with</p>
    <p class=l>when jove to punish faithless men prepares,<br />and gives whole nations to the waste of wars,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one another—even so did huge ajax, bulwark of the achaeans,</p>
    <p class=l>thus march’d the chief, tremendous as a god;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spring forward with a grim smile on his face as he brandished his</p>
    <p class=l>grimly he smiled; earth trembled as he strode:[183]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>long spear and strode onward.</p>
    <p class=l>his massy javelin quivering in his hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the argives were elated as they</p>
    <p class=l>he stood, the bulwark of the grecian band.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beheld him, but the trojans trembled in every limb, and the heart</p>
    <p class=l>through every argive heart new transport ran;<br />all troy stood trembling at the mighty man:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even of hector beat quickly, but he could not now retreat and</p>
    <p class=l>even hector paused; and with new doubt oppress’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>withdraw into the ranks behind him, for he had been the</p>
    <p class=l>felt his great heart suspended in his breast:<br />’twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>challenger.</p>
    <p class=l>himself had challenged, and the foe drew near.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax came up bearing his shield in front of him like</p>
    <p class=l>stern telamon behind his ample shield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a wall—a shield of bronze with seven folds of ox-hide—the work of</p>
    <p class=l>as from a brazen tower, o’erlook’d the field.<br />huge was its orb, with seven thick folds o’ercast,<br />of tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tychius, who lived in hyle and was by far the best worker in</p>
    <p class=l>(the work of tychius, who in hylè dwell’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>leather.</p>
    <p class=l>and in all arts of armoury excell’d,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he had made it with the hides of seven full-fed bulls,</p>
    <p class=l>this ajax bore before his manly breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze.</p>
    <p class=l>and, threatening, thus his adverse chief address’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>holding this</p>
    <p class=l>“hector!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shield before him, ajax son of telamon came close up to hector,</p>
    <p class=l>approach my arm, and singly know</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and menaced him saying, “hector, you shall now learn, man to man,</p>
    <p class=l>what strength thou hast, and what the grecian foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what kind of champions the danaans have among them even besides</p>
    <p class=l>achilles shuns the fight; yet some there are,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lion-hearted achilles cleaver of the ranks of men.</p>
    <p class=l>not void of soul, and not unskill’d in war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he now abides</p>
    <p class=l>let him, unactive on the sea-beat shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at the ships in anger with agamemnon shepherd of his people, but</p>
    <p class=l>indulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;<br />whole troops of heroes greece has yet to boast,<br />and sends thee one, a sample of her host,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there are many of us who are well able to face you; therefore</p>
    <p class=l>such as i am, i come to prove thy might;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>begin the fight.</p>
    <p class=l>no more—be sudden, and begin the fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and hector answered, “noble ajax, son of telamon, captain of the</p>
    <p class=l>“o son of telamon, thy country’s pride!<br />(to ajax thus the trojan prince replied)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>host, treat me not as though i were some puny boy or woman that</p>
    <p class=l>me, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cannot fight.</p>
    <p class=l>new to the field, and trembling at the fight?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have been long used to the blood and butcheries</p>
    <p class=l>thou meet’st a chief deserving of thy arms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of battle.</p>
    <p class=l>to combat born, and bred amidst alarms:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i am quick to turn my leathern shield either to right</p>
    <p class=l>i know to shift my ground, remount the car,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or left, for this i deem the main thing in battle.</p>
    <p class=l>turn, charge, and answer every call of war;<br />to right, to left, the dexterous lance i wield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i can charge</p>
    <p class=l>and bear thick battle on my sounding shield/</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among the chariots and horsemen, and in hand to hand fighting can</p>
    <p class=l>but open be our fight, and bold each blow;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>delight the heart of mars; howbeit i would not take such a man as<br />you are off his guard—but i will smite you openly if i can.</p>
    <p class=l>i steal no conquest from a noble foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him.<br />it</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and rising, high above the field</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>struck the sevenfold shield in its outermost layer—the eighth,</p>
    <p class=l>whirl’d the long lance against the sevenfold shield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which was of bronze—and went through six of the layers but in the</p>
    <p class=l>full on the brass descending from above<br />through six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seventh hide it stayed.</p>
    <p class=l>till in the seventh it fix’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then ajax threw in his turn, and struck</p>
    <p class=l>then ajax threw;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the round shield of the son of priam.<br />the terrible spear went<br />through his gleaming shield, and pressed onward through his</p>
    <p class=l>through hector’s shield the forceful javelin flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cuirass of cunning workmanship; it pierced the shirt against his</p>
    <p class=l>his corslet enters, and his garment rends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>side, but he swerved and thus saved his life.</p>
    <p class=l>and glancing downwards, near his flank descends.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they then each of</p>
    <p class=l>the wary trojan shrinks, and bending low</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them drew out the spear from his shield, and fell on one another</p>
    <p class=l>beneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.<br />from their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like savage lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance:</p>
    <p class=l>then close impetuous, and the charge renew;<br />fierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,<br />or foaming boars, the terror of the wood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of priam struck the middle of ajax’s shield, but the</p>
    <p class=l>at ajax, hector his long lance extends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bronze did not break, and the point of his dart was turned.</p>
    <p class=l>the blunted point against the buckler bends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax</p>
    <p class=l>but ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then sprang forward and pierced the shield of hector; the spear</p>
    <p class=l>drove through the trojan targe the knotty spear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went through it and staggered him as he was springing forward to</p>
    <p class=l>it reach’d his neck, with matchless strength impell’d!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>attack; it gashed his neck and the blood came pouring from the</p>
    <p class=l>spouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wound, but even so hector did not cease fighting; he gave ground,</p>
    <p class=l>yet ceased not hector thus; but stooping down,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and with his brawny hand seized a stone, rugged and huge, that</p>
    <p class=l>in his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was lying upon the plain; with this he struck the shield of ajax</p>
    <p class=l>black, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on the boss that was in its middle, so that the bronze rang</p>
    <p class=l>full on the brazen boss the stone descends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>again.</p>
    <p class=l>the hollow brass resounded with the shock:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but ajax in turn caught up a far larger stone, swung it</p>
    <p class=l>then ajax seized the fragment of a rock,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aloft, and hurled it with prodigious force.</p>
    <p class=l>applied each nerve, and swinging round on high,<br />with force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this millstone of a</p>
    <p class=l>the huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rock broke hector’s shield inwards and threw him down on his back</p>
    <p class=l>his slacken’d knees received the numbing stroke;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with the shield crushing him under it, but apollo raised him at</p>
    <p class=l>great hector falls extended on the field,<br />his bulk supporting on the shatter’d shield:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>once.</p>
    <p class=l>nor wanted heavenly aid: apollo’s might</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon they would have hacked at one another in close</p>
    <p class=l>confirm’d his sinews, and restored to fight.<br />and now both heroes their broad falchions drew</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>combat with their swords, had not heralds, messengers of gods and</p>
    <p class=l>in flaming circles round their heads they flew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men, come forward, one from the trojans and the other from the</p>
    <p class=l>but then by heralds’ voice the word was given.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans—talthybius and idaeus both of them honourable men; these</p>
    <p class=l>the sacred ministers of earth and heaven:<br />divine talthybius, whom the greeks employ,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>parted them with their staves, and the good herald idaeus said,</p>
    <p class=l>and sage idæus on the part of troy,<br />between the swords their peaceful sceptres rear’d;<br />and first idæus’ awful voice was heard:<br />[illustration: ] hector and ajax separated by the heralds</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my sons, fight no longer, you are both of you valiant, and both</p>
    <p class=l>“forbear, my sons!<br />your further force to prove,<br />both dear to men, and both beloved of jove.<br />to either host your matchless worth is known,<br />each sounds your praise, and war is all your own.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are dear to jove; we know this; but night is now falling, and the</p>
    <p class=l>but now the night extends her awful shade;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>behests of night may not be well gainsaid.</p>
    <p class=l>the goddess parts you; be the night obey’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”[184]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax son of telamon answered, “idaeus, bid hector say so, for it</p>
    <p class=l>to whom great ajax his high soul express’d:<br />“o sage!<br />to hector be these words address’d.</p>

    <p class=r>was he that challenged our princes.</p>
    <p class=l>let him, who first provoked our chiefs to fight,<br />let him demand the sanction of the night;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let him speak first and i</p>
    <p class=l>if first he ask’d it, i content obey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will accept his saying.</p>
    <p class=l>and cease the strife when hector shows the way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”<br />“o first of greeks!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then hector said, “ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature and</p>
    <p class=l>(his noble foe rejoin’d)<br />whom heaven adorns, superior to thy kind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strength, and judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel all</p>
    <p class=l>with strength of body, and with worth of mind!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>others of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>now martial law commands us to forbear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us for this day cease fighting;</p>
    <p class=l>hereafter we shall meet in glorious war,<br />some future day shall lengthen out the strife,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hereafter we will fight anew till heaven decide between us, and</p>
    <p class=l>and let the gods decide of death or life!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>give victory to one or to the other; night is now falling, and</p>
    <p class=l>since, then, the night extends her gloomy shade,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the behests of night may not be well gainsaid.</p>
    <p class=l>and heaven enjoins it, be the night obey’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gladden, then, the</p>
    <p class=l>return, brave ajax, to thy grecian friends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hearts of the achaeans at your ships, and more especially those<br />of your own followers and clansmen, while i, in the great city of</p>
    <p class=l>and joy the nations whom thy arm defends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>king priam, bring comfort to the trojans and their women, who vie</p>
    <p class=l>as i shall glad each chief, and trojan wife,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with one another in their prayers on my behalf.</p>
    <p class=l>who wearies heaven with vows for hector’s life.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us, moreover,</p>
    <p class=l>but let us, on this memorable day,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>exchange presents that it may be said among the achaeans and</p>
    <p class=l>exchange some gift: that greece and troy may say,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans, ‘they fought with might and main, but were reconciled</p>
    <p class=l>‘not hate, but glory, made these chiefs contend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and parted in friendship.</p>
    <p class=l>and each brave foe was in his soul a friend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>’”</p>
    <p class=l>’”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this he gave ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath and</p>
    <p class=l>with that, a sword with stars of silver graced,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>leathern baldric, and in return ajax gave him a girdle dyed with</p>
    <p class=l>the baldric studded, and the sheath enchased,<br />he gave the greek.<br />the generous greek bestow’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>purple.</p>
    <p class=l>a radiant belt that rich with purple glow’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus they parted, the one going to the host of the</p>
    <p class=l>then with majestic grace they quit the plain;<br />this seeks the grecian, that the phrygian train.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans, and the other to that of the trojans, who rejoiced when</p>
    <p class=l>the trojan bands returning hector wait,<br />and hail with joy the champion of their state;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they saw their hero come to them safe and unharmed from the</p>
    <p class=l>escaped great ajax, they survey him round,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strong hands of mighty ajax.</p>
    <p class=l>alive, unarm’d, and vigorous from his wound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they led him, therefore, to the city</p>
    <p class=l>to troy’s high gates the godlike man they bear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as one that had been saved beyond their hopes.</p>
    <p class=l>their present triumph, as their late despair.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on the other side</p>
    <p class=l>but ajax, glorying in his hardy deed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans brought ajax elated with victory to agamemnon.<br />when they reached the quarters of the son of atreus, agamemnon</p>
    <p class=l>the well-arm’d greeks to agamemnon lead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sacrificed for them a five-year-old bull in honour of jove the</p>
    <p class=l>a steer for sacrifice the king design’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of saturn.</p>
    <p class=l>of full five years, and of the nobler kind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they flayed the carcass, made it ready, and</p>
    <p class=l>the victim falls; they strip the smoking hide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>divided it into joints; these they cut carefully up into smaller<br />pieces, putting them on the spits, roasting them sufficiently,</p>
    <p class=l>the beast they quarter, and the joints divide;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and then drawing them off.</p>
    <p class=l>then spread the tables, the repast prepare,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they had done all this and had<br />prepared the feast, they ate it, and every man had his full and</p>
    <p class=l>each takes his seat, and each receives his share.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>equal share, so that all were satisfied, and king agamemnon gave</p>
    <p class=l>the king himself (an honorary sign)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax some slices cut lengthways down the loin, as a mark of</p>
    <p class=l>before great ajax placed the mighty chine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>special honour.</p>
    <p class=l>[185]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,</p>
    <p class=l>when now the rage of hunger was removed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>old nestor whose counsel was ever truest began to speak; with all</p>
    <p class=l>nestor, in each persuasive art approved,<br />the sage whose counsels long had sway’d the rest,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:—</p>
    <p class=l>in words like these his prudent thought express’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“son of atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the</p>
    <p class=l>“how dear, o kings!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans are now dead, whose blood mars has shed by the banks of</p>
    <p class=l>this fatal day has cost,<br />what greeks are perish’d!<br />what a people lost!<br />what tides of blood have drench’d scamander’s shore!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the scamander, and their souls have gone down to the house of</p>
    <p class=l>what crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hades, it will be well when morning comes that we should cease</p>
    <p class=l>then hear me, chief!<br />nor let the morrow’s light</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fighting; we will then wheel our dead together with oxen and</p>
    <p class=l>awake thy squadrons to new toils of fight:<br />some space at least permit the war to breathe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mules and burn them not far from the ships, that when we sail</p>
    <p class=l>while we to flames our slaughter’d friends bequeath,<br />from the red field their scatter’d bodies bear,<br />and nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hence we may take the bones of our comrades home to their</p>
    <p class=l>so decent urns their snowy bones may keep,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>children.</p>
    <p class=l>and pious children o’er their ashes weep.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hard by the funeral pyre we will build a barrow that</p>
    <p class=l>here, where on one promiscuous pile they blazed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall be raised from the plain for all in common; near this let</p>
    <p class=l>high o’er them all a general tomb be raised;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>us set about building a high wall, to shelter ourselves and our</p>
    <p class=l>next, to secure our camp and naval powers,<br />raise an embattled wall, with lofty towers;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships, and let it have well-made gates that there may be a way</p>
    <p class=l>from space to space be ample gates around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through them for our chariots.<br />close outside we will dig a deep</p>
    <p class=l>for passing chariots; and a trench profound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trench all round it to keep off both horse and foot, that the</p>
    <p class=l>so greece to combat shall in safety go,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojan chieftains may not bear hard upon us.</p>
    <p class=l>nor fear the fierce incursions of the foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus he spoke, and the princes shouted in applause.</p>
    <p class=l>’twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved;<br />the sceptred kings of greece his words approved.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile, convened at priam’s palace-gate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the</p>
    <p class=l>the trojan peers in nightly council sate;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>acropolis by the gates of king priam’s palace; and wise antenor</p>
    <p class=l>a senate void of order, as of choice:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spoke.</p>
    <p class=l>their hearts were fearful, and confused their voice.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“hear me,” he said, “trojans, dardanians, and allies, that</p>
    <p class=l>antenor, rising, thus demands their ear:<br />“ye trojans, dardans, and auxiliars, hear!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i may speak even as i am minded.</p>
    <p class=l>’tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us give up argive helen and</p>
    <p class=l>and i but move what every god requires:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her wealth to the sons of atreus, for we are now fighting in</p>
    <p class=l>let sparta’s treasures be this hour restored,<br />and argive helen own her ancient lord.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>violation of our solemn covenants, and shall not prosper till we</p>
    <p class=l>the ties of faith, the sworn alliance, broke,<br />our impious battles the just gods provoke.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have done as i say.</p>
    <p class=l>as this advice ye practise, or reject,<br />so hope success, or dread the dire effect.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then sat down and alexandrus husband of lovely helen rose to</p>
    <p class=l>the senior spoke and sate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>speak.</p>
    <p class=l>to whom replied</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“antenor,” said he, “your words are not to my liking; you</p>
    <p class=l>the graceful husband of the spartan bride:<br />“cold counsels, trojan, may become thy years<br />but sound ungrateful in a warrior’s ears:<br />old man, if void of fallacy or art,<br />thy words express the purpose of thy heart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can find a better saying than this if you will; if, however, you</p>
    <p class=l>thou, in thy time, more sound advice hast given;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of<br />your reason.</p>
    <p class=l>but wisdom has its date, assign’d by heaven.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will speak plainly, and hereby notify to the</p>
    <p class=l>then hear me, princes of the trojan name!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans that i will not give up the woman; but the wealth that i</p>
    <p class=l>their treasures i’ll restore, but not the dame;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brought home with her from argos i will restore, and will add yet</p>
    <p class=l>my treasures too, for peace, i will resign;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>further of my own.</p>
    <p class=l>but be this bright possession ever mine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this, when paris had spoken and taken his seat, priam of the</p>
    <p class=l>’twas then, the growing discord to compose,<br />slow from his seat the reverend priam rose:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>race of dardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all</p>
    <p class=l>his godlike aspect deep attention drew:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: “hear me, trojans,</p>
    <p class=l>he paused, and these pacific words ensue:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dardanians, and allies, that i may speak even as i am minded.</p>
    <p class=l>“ye trojans, dardans, and auxiliar bands!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>get<br />your suppers now as hitherto throughout the city, but keep your</p>
    <p class=l>now take refreshment as the hour demands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>watches and be wakeful.</p>
    <p class=l>guard well the walls, relieve the watch of night.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at daybreak let idaeus go to the ships,</p>
    <p class=l>till the new sun restores the cheerful light.<br />then shall our herald, to the atrides sent,<br />before their ships proclaim my son’s intent.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and tell agamemnon and menelaus sons of atreus the saying of</p>
    <p class=l>next let a truce be ask’d, that troy may burn</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alexandrus through whom this quarrel has come about; and let him</p>
    <p class=l>her slaughter’d heroes, and their bones inurn;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>also be instant with them that they now cease fighting till we<br />burn our dead; hereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide</p>
    <p class=l>that done, once more the fate of war be tried,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>between us and give victory to one or to the other.</p>
    <p class=l>and whose the conquest, mighty jove decide!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said.</p>
    <p class=l>the monarch spoke: the warriors snatch’d with haste</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they took</p>
    <p class=l>(each at his post in arms) a short repast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>supper in their companies and at daybreak idaeus went his way to</p>
    <p class=l>soon as the rosy morn had waked the day,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>to the black ships idæus bent his way;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he found the danaans, servants of mars, in council at<br />the stern of agamemnon’s ship, and took his place in the midst of</p>
    <p class=l>there, to the sons of mars, in council found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them.</p>
    <p class=l>he raised his voice: the host stood listening round.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“son of atreus,” he said, “and princes of the achaean host,</p>
    <p class=l>“ye sons of atreus, and ye greeks, give ear!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam and the other noble trojans have sent me to tell you the</p>
    <p class=l>the words of troy, and troy’s great monarch, hear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saying of alexandrus through whom this quarrel has come about, if</p>
    <p class=l>pleased may ye hear (so heaven succeed my prayers)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so be that you may find it acceptable.</p>
    <p class=l>what paris, author of the war, declares.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all the treasure he took</p>
    <p class=l>the spoils and treasures he to ilion bore</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with him in his ships to troy—would that he had sooner</p>
    <p class=l>(oh had he perish’d ere they touch’d our shore!<br />)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>perished—he will restore, and will add yet further of his own,</p>
    <p class=l>he proffers injured greece: with large increase<br />of added trojan wealth to buy the peace.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but he will not give up the wedded wife of menelaus, though the</p>
    <p class=l>but to restore the beauteous bride again,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans would have him do so.</p>
    <p class=l>this greece demands, and troy requests in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam bade me inquire further if</p>
    <p class=l>next, o ye chiefs!<br />we ask a truce to burn</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you will cease fighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will</p>
    <p class=l>our slaughter’d heroes, and their bones inurn.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight anew, till heaven decide between us and give victory to one</p>
    <p class=l>that done, once more the fate of war be tried,<br />and whose the conquest, mighty jove decide!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or to the other.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they all held their peace, but presently diomed of the loud</p>
    <p class=l>the greeks gave ear, but none the silence broke;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>war-cry spoke, saying, “let there be no taking, neither treasure,</p>
    <p class=l>at length tydides rose, and rising spoke:<br />“oh, take not, friends!<br />defrauded of your fame,<br />their proffer’d wealth, nor even the spartan dame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nor yet helen, for even a child may see that the doom of the</p>
    <p class=l>let conquest make them ours: fate shakes their wall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans is at hand.</p>
    <p class=l>and troy already totters to her fall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sons of the achaeans shouted applause at the words that</p>
    <p class=l>the admiring chiefs, and all the grecian name,<br />with general shouts return’d him loud acclaim.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed had spoken, and thereon king agamemnon said to idaeus,</p>
    <p class=l>then thus the king of kings rejects the peace:<br />“herald!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“idaeus, you have heard the answer the achaeans make you and i<br />with them.</p>
    <p class=l>in him thou hear’st the voice of greece</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but as concerning the dead, i give you leave to burn</p>
    <p class=l>for what remains; let funeral flames be fed</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them, for when men are once dead there should be no grudging them</p>
    <p class=l>with heroes’ corps: i war not with the dead:<br />go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the rites of fire.</p>
    <p class=l>and gratify the manes of the slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let jove the mighty husband of juno be witness</p>
    <p class=l>be witness, jove, whose thunder rolls on high!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to this covenant.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods,<br />and idaeus went back to the strong city of ilius.</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and rear’d his sceptre to the sky.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans and</p>
    <p class=l>to sacred troy, where all her princes lay</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dardanians were gathered in council waiting his return; when he</p>
    <p class=l>to wait the event, the herald bent his way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came, he stood in their midst and delivered his message.</p>
    <p class=l>he came, and standing in the midst, explain’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as soon</p>
    <p class=l>the peace rejected, but the truce obtain’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as they heard it they set about their twofold labour, some to</p>
    <p class=l>straight to their several cares the trojans move,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gather the corpses, and others to bring in wood.</p>
    <p class=l>some search the plains, some fell the sounding grove:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the argives on<br />their part also hastened from their ships, some to gather the</p>
    <p class=l>nor less the greeks, descending on the shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>corpses, and others to bring in wood.</p>
    <p class=l>hew’d the green forests, and the bodies bore.<br />and now from forth the chambers of the main,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into</p>
    <p class=l>to shed his sacred light on earth again,<br />arose the golden chariot of the day,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the vault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep oceanus,</p>
    <p class=l>and tipp’d the mountains with a purple ray.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the two armies met.</p>
    <p class=l>in mingled throngs the greek and trojan train</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they could hardly recognise their dead,</p>
    <p class=l>through heaps of carnage search’d the mournful plain.<br />scarce could the friend his slaughter’d friend explore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but they washed the clotted gore from off them, shed tears over</p>
    <p class=l>with dust dishonour’d, and deformed with gore.<br />the wounds they wash’d, their pious tears they shed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them, and lifted them upon their waggons.</p>
    <p class=l>and, laid along their cars, deplored the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam had forbidden the</p>
    <p class=l>sage priam check’d their grief: with silent haste</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans to wail aloud, so they heaped their dead sadly and</p>
    <p class=l>the bodies decent on the piles were placed:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>silently upon the pyre, and having burned them went back to the</p>
    <p class=l>with melting hearts the cold remains they burn’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>city of ilius.</p>
    <p class=l>and, sadly slow, to sacred troy return’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans in like manner heaped their dead</p>
    <p class=l>nor less the greeks their pious sorrows shed,<br />and decent on the pile dispose the dead;<br />the cold remains consume with equal care;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sadly and silently on the pyre, and having burned them went back<br />to their ships.</p>
    <p class=l>and slowly, sadly, to their fleet repair.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of the</p>
    <p class=l>now, ere the morn had streak’d with reddening light<br />the doubtful confines of the day and night,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that</p>
    <p class=l>about the dying flames the greeks appear’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was raised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high</p>
    <p class=l>and round the pile a general tomb they rear’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wall to shelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong</p>
    <p class=l>then, to secure the camp and naval powers,<br />they raised embattled walls with lofty towers:[186]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gates that there might be a way through them for their chariots,</p>
    <p class=l>from space to space were ample gates around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and close outside it they dug a trench deep and wide, and they</p>
    <p class=l>for passing chariots, and a trench profound<br />of large extent; and deep in earth below,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>planted it within with stakes.</p>
    <p class=l>strong piles infix’d stood adverse to the foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did the achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of</p>
    <p class=l>so toil’d the greeks: meanwhile the gods above,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove the lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but</p>
    <p class=l>in shining circle round their father jove,<br />amazed beheld the wondrous works of man:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neptune, lord of the earthquake, spoke, saying, “father jove,</p>
    <p class=l>then he, whose trident shakes the earth, began:</p>

    <p class=r>what mortal in the whole world will again take the gods into his</p>

    <p class=r>see you not how the achaeans have built a wall about</p>
    <p class=l>if the proud grecians thus successful boast</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their ships and driven a trench all round it, without offering<br />hecatombs to the gods?</p>
    <p class=l>their rising bulwarks on the sea-beat coast?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fame of this wall will reach as far as</p>
    <p class=l>see the long walls extending to the main,</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove was displeased and answered, “what, o shaker of the earth,</p>
    <p class=l>thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep.<br />the almighty thunderer with a frown replies,</p>

    <p class=r>surely when the achaeans have gone home with their</p>

    <p class=r>thus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>thus they in heaven: while, o’er the grecian train,<br />the rolling sun descending to the main</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was completed; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got</p>

    <p class=r>their supper.</p>
    <p class=l>their bulls they slew;</p>

    <p class=r>many ships had come with wine from lemnos, sent by</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from this supply the achaeans bought their wine, some with</p>
    <p class=l>the rest they purchased at their proper cost,<br />and well the plenteous freight supplied the host:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bronze, some with iron, some with hides, some with whole heifers,</p>
    <p class=l>each, in exchange, proportion’d treasures gave;[188]</p>

    <p class=r>and some again with captives.</p>
    <p class=l>some, brass or iron; some, an ox, or slave.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they spread a goodly banquet and<br />feasted the whole night through, as also did the trojans and</p>
    <p class=l>all night they feast, the greek and trojan powers:</p>

    <p class=r>their allies in the city.</p>
    <p class=l>those on the fields, and these within their towers.</p>

    <p class=r>and roared with his portentous thunder.</p>
    <p class=l>and shot red lightnings through the gloomy shade:</p>

    <p class=l>“celestial states!<br />immortal gods!<br />give ear,</p>

    <p class=l>rapt by the ethereal steeds the chariot roll’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze and<br />manes of glittering gold.</p>
    <p class=l>brass were their hoofs, their curling manes of gold:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he girded himself also with gold about</p>
    <p class=l>of heaven’s undrossy gold the gods array,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the body, seized his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>refulgent, flash’d intolerable day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon he lashed his horses and they flew forward nothing loth</p>
    <p class=l>high on the throne he shines: his coursers fly</p>

    <p class=r>midway twixt earth and starry heaven.</p>
    <p class=l>between the extended earth and starry sky.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after a while he reached</p>
    <p class=l>but when to ida’s topmost height he came,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many-fountained ida, mother of wild beasts, and gargarus, where</p>
    <p class=l>(fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game,)<br />where o’er her pointed summits proudly raised,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are his grove and fragrant altar.</p>
    <p class=l>his fane breathed odours, and his altar blazed:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there the father of gods and</p>
    <p class=l>there, from his radiant car, the sacred sire<br />of gods and men released the steeds of fire:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men stayed his horses, took them from the chariot, and hid them</p>
    <p class=l>blue ambient mists the immortal steeds embraced;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in a thick cloud; then he took his seat all glorious upon the</p>
    <p class=l>high on the cloudy point his seat he placed;<br />thence his broad eye the subject world surveys,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>topmost crests, looking down upon the city of troy and the ships<br />of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the town, and tents, and navigable seas.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, and</p>
    <p class=l>now had the grecians snatch’d a short repast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>afterwards put on their armour.</p>
    <p class=l>and buckled on their shining arms with haste.</p>

    <p class=r>the trojans on the other hand</p>
    <p class=l>troy roused as soon; for on this dreadful day</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>likewise armed themselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers<br />but nevertheless eager perforce to do battle for their wives and<br />children.</p>
    <p class=l>the fate of fathers, wives, and infants lay.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all the gates were flung wide open, and horse and foot</p>
    <p class=l>the gates unfolding pour forth all their train;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sallied forth with the tramp as of a great multitude.</p>
    <p class=l>squadrons on squadrons cloud the dusky plain:<br />men, steeds, and chariots shake the trembling ground,<br />the tumult thickens, and the skies resound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they were got together in one place, shield clashed with</p>
    <p class=l>and now with shouts the shocking armies closed,</p>

    <p class=l>victors and vanquish’d join promiscuous cries,<br />triumphant shouts and dying groans arise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the earth ran red with blood.</p>
    <p class=l>with streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,<br />and slaughter’d heroes swell the dreadful tide.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning their</p>
    <p class=l>long as the morning beams, increasing bright,<br />o’er heaven’s clear azure spread the sacred light,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>weapons beat against one another, and the people fell, but when</p>
    <p class=l>commutual death the fate of war confounds,<br />each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sun had reached mid-heaven, the sire of all balanced his</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>golden scales, and put two fates of death within them, one for</p>
    <p class=l>the sire of gods his golden scales suspends,[192]<br />with equal hand: in these explored the fate</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans and the other for the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>of greece and troy, and poised the mighty weight:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he took the balance<br />by the middle, and when he lifted it up the day of the achaeans<br />sank; the death-fraught scale of the achaeans settled down upon</p>
    <p class=l>press’d with its load, the grecian balance lies</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ground, while that of the trojans rose heavenwards.</p>
    <p class=l>low sunk on earth, the trojan strikes the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he</p>
    <p class=l>then jove from ida’s top his horrors spreads;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thundered aloud from ida, and sent the glare of his lightning</p>
    <p class=l>the clouds burst dreadful o’er the grecian heads;<br />thick lightnings flash; the muttering thunder rolls;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon the achaeans; when they saw this, pale fear fell upon them</p>
    <p class=l>their strength he withers, and unmans their souls.<br />before his wrath the trembling hosts retire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and they were sore afraid.</p>
    <p class=l>the gods in terrors, and the skies on fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lovely helen had hit it with an arrow just on the top of its head</p>
    <p class=l>curl’d o’er the brow, it stung him to the brain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>where the mane begins to grow away from the skull, a very deadly</p>

    <p class=r>the horse bounded in his anguish as the arrow pierced his<br />brain, and his struggles threw others into confusion.</p>
    <p class=l>scarce had his falchion cut the reins, and freed</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>perished there and then had not diomed been quick to mark, and<br />with a loud cry called ulysses to help him.</p>
    <p class=l>he rush’d, and on ulysses call’d aloud:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“ulysses,” he cried, “noble son of laertes where are you flying</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>struck with a spear between the shoulders.</p>
    <p class=l>pierced in the back, a vile, dishonest wound?</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=r>to defend nestor from this man’s furious onset.</p>

    <p class=r>neleus.</p>
    <p class=l>“great perils, father!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“sir,” said he, “these young warriors are pressing you</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hard, your force is spent, and age is heavy upon you, your squire</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nestor knight of gerene hearkened to his words.</p>
    <p class=l>thus said the chief; and nestor, skill’d in war,</p>

    <p class=r>thereon the</p>
    <p class=l>approves his counsel, and ascends the car:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>doughty squires, sthenelus and kind-hearted eurymedon, saw to</p>
    <p class=l>the steeds he left, their trusty servants hold;<br />eurymedon, and sthenelus the bold:<br />the reverend charioteer directs the course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nestor’s horses, while the two both mounted diomed’s chariot.<br />nestor took the reins in his hands and lashed the horses on; they</p>
    <p class=l>and strains his aged arm to lash the horse.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were soon close up with hector, and the son of tydeus aimed a</p>
    <p class=l>hector they face; unknowing how to fear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear at him as he was charging full speed towards them.</p>
    <p class=l>fierce he drove on; tydides whirl’d his spear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>the spear with erring haste mistook its way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>missed him, but struck his charioteer and squire eniopeus son of<br />noble thebaeus in the breast by the nipple while the reins were</p>
    <p class=l>but plunged in eniopeus’ bosom lay.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in his hands, so that he died there and then, and the horses</p>
    <p class=l>his opening hand in death forsakes the rein;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>swerved as he fell headlong from the chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>the steeds fly back: he falls, and spurns the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector was greatly</p>
    <p class=l>great hector sorrows for his servant kill’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but let him lie for all</p>
    <p class=l>yet unrevenged permits to press the field;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his sorrow, while he went in quest of another driver; nor did his<br />steeds have to go long without one, for he presently found brave</p>
    <p class=l>till, to supply his place and rule the car,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>archeptolemus the son of iphitus, and made him get up behind the<br />horses, giving the reins into his hand.</p>
    <p class=l>rose archeptolemus, the fierce in war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all had then been lost and no help for it, for they would have</p>
    <p class=l>and now had death and horror cover’d all;[193]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>been penned up in ilius like sheep, had not the sire of gods and</p>
    <p class=l>like timorous flocks the trojans in their wall<br />inclosed had bled: but jove with awful sound</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men been quick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt</p>
    <p class=l>roll’d the big thunder o’er the vast profound:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which fell just in front of diomed’s horses with a flare of</p>
    <p class=l>full in tydides’ face the lightning flew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>burning brimstone.</p>
    <p class=l>the ground before him flamed with sulphur blue;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the horses were frightened and tried to back</p>
    <p class=l>the quivering steeds fell prostrate at the sight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beneath the car, while the reins dropped from nestor’s hands.</p>
    <p class=l>and nestor’s trembling hand confess’d his fright:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he was afraid and said to diomed, “son of tydeus, turn your</p>

    <p class=l>’tis not in man his fix’d decree to move:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brave, may thwart the purpose of jove, for he is far stronger</p>
    <p class=l>the great will glory to submit to jove.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>than any.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>“o reverend prince!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed answered, “all that you have said is true; there is a</p>
    <p class=l>(tydides thus replies)<br />thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grief however which pierces me to the very heart, for hector will</p>
    <p class=l>but ah, what grief!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>talk among the trojans and say, ‘the son of tydeus fled before me</p>

    <p class=r>to the ships.</p>

    <p class=r>swallow me.<br />”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“son of tydeus,” replied nestor, “what mean you?</p>
    <p class=l>to whom gerenian nestor thus replied:[194]</p>

    <p class=r>so saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battle, and with a cry that rent the air the trojans and hector</p>
    <p class=l>the shouts of trojans thicken in the wind;</p>

    <p class=r>rained their darts after them.</p>
    <p class=l>the storm of hissing javelins pours behind.</p>

    <p class=r>thus did he vaunt, but queen juno made high olympus quake as she</p>
    <p class=l>that heard, deep anguish stung saturnia’s soul;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shook with rage upon her throne.</p>
    <p class=l>she shook her throne, that shook the starry pole:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then said she to the mighty god</p>
    <p class=l>and thus to neptune: “thou, whose force can make</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of neptune, “what now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake?</p>
    <p class=l>the stedfast earth from her foundations shake,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can</p>
    <p class=l>seest thou the greeks by fates unjust oppress’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you find no compassion in your heart for the dying danaans, who<br />bring you many a welcome offering to helice and to aegae?</p>
    <p class=l>nor swells thy heart in that immortal breast?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wish</p>
    <p class=l>yet ægae, helicè, thy power obey,[195]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them well then.</p>
    <p class=l>and gifts unceasing on thine altars lay.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if all of us who are with the danaans were to</p>
    <p class=l>would all the deities of greece combine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drive the trojans back and keep jove from helping them, he would</p>
    <p class=l>in vain the gloomy thunderer might repine:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have to sit there sulking alone on ida.</p>
    <p class=l>sole should he sit, with scarce a god to friend,<br />and see his trojans to the shades descend:<br />such be the scene from his idaean bower;<br />ungrateful prospect to the sullen power!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>king neptune was greatly troubled and answered, “juno, rash of</p>
    <p class=l>neptune with wrath rejects the rash design:<br />“what rage, what madness, furious queen!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tongue, what are you talking about?</p>
    <p class=l>is thine?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we other gods must not set</p>
    <p class=l>i war not with the highest.<br />all above</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ourselves against jove, for he is far stronger than we are.</p>
    <p class=l>submit and tremble at the hand of jove.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the</p>
    <p class=l>now godlike hector, to whose matchless might</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ditch, from the ships even to the wall, was filled with horses</p>
    <p class=l>jove gave the glory of the destined fight,<br />squadrons on squadrons drives, and fills the fields<br />with close-ranged chariots, and with thicken’d shields.<br />where the deep trench in length extended lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and warriors, who were pent up there by hector son of priam, now</p>
    <p class=l>compacted troops stand wedged in firm array,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that the hand of jove was with him.</p>
    <p class=l>a dreadful front!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he would even have set fire</p>
    <p class=l>they shake the brands, and threat</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to the ships and burned them, had not queen juno put it into the</p>
    <p class=l>with long-destroying flames the hostile fleet.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mind of agamemnon, to bestir himself and to encourage the</p>
    <p class=l>the king of men, by juno’s self inspired,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>toil’d through the tents, and all his army fired.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to this end he went round the ships and tents carrying</p>
    <p class=l>swift as he moved, he lifted in his hand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a great purple cloak, and took his stand by the huge black hull</p>
    <p class=l>his purple robe, bright ensign of command.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of ulysses’ ship, which was middlemost of all; it was from this</p>
    <p class=l>high on the midmost bark the king appear’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>place that his voice would carry farthest, on the one hand</p>
    <p class=l>there, from ulysses’ deck, his voice was heard:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>towards the tents of ajax son of telamon, and on the other<br />towards those of achilles—for these two heroes, well assured of</p>
    <p class=l>to ajax and achilles reach’d the sound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their own strength, had valorously drawn up their ships at the</p>
    <p class=l>whose distant ships the guarded navy bound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two ends of the line.</p>
    <p class=l>“o argives!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from this spot then, with a voice that</p>
    <p class=l>shame of human race!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>could be heard afar, he shouted to the danaans, saying, “argives,</p>
    <p class=l>(he cried:<br />the hollow vessels to his voice replied,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shame on you cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only; where<br />are now our vaunts that we should prove victorious—the vaunts we<br />made so vaingloriously in lemnos, when we ate the flesh of horned</p>
    <p class=l>where now are all your glorious boasts of yore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cattle and filled our mixing-bowls to the brim?<br />you vowed that</p>
    <p class=l>your hasty triumphs on the lemnian shore?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you would each of you stand against a hundred or two hundred men,</p>
    <p class=l>each fearless hero dares a hundred foes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now you prove no match even for one—for hector, who will be</p>
    <p class=l>while the feast lasts, and while the goblet flows;<br />but who to meet one martial man is found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ere long setting our ships in a blaze.</p>
    <p class=l>when the fight rages, and the flames surround?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father jove, did you ever</p>
    <p class=l>o mighty jove!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so ruin a great king and rob him so utterly of his greatness?</p>
    <p class=l>o sire of the distress’d!<br />was ever king like me, like me oppress’d?<br />with power immense, with justice arm’d in vain;<br />my glory ravish’d, and my people slain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yet, when to my sorrow i was coming hither, i never let my ship</p>
    <p class=l>to thee my vows were breathed from every shore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pass your altars without offering the fat and thigh-bones of</p>
    <p class=l>what altar smoked not with our victims’ gore?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heifers upon every one of them, so eager was i to sack the city</p>
    <p class=l>with fat of bulls i fed the constant flame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of troy.</p>
    <p class=l>and ask’d destruction to the trojan name.<br />now, gracious god!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vouchsafe me then this prayer—suffer us to escape at any</p>
    <p class=l>far humbler our demand;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rate with our lives, and let not the achaeans be so utterly</p>
    <p class=l>give these at least to ’scape from hector’s hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vanquished by the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>and save the relics of the grecian land!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he pray, and father jove pitying his tears vouchsafed</p>
    <p class=l>thus pray’d the king, and heaven’s great father heard</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him that his people should live, not die; forthwith he sent them</p>
    <p class=l>his vows, in bitterness of soul preferr’d:<br />the wrath appeased, by happy signs declares,<br />and gives the people to their monarch’s prayers.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>an eagle, most unfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young</p>
    <p class=l>his eagle, sacred bird of heaven!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fawn in its talons; the eagle dropped the fawn by the altar on</p>
    <p class=l>he sent,<br />a fawn his talons truss’d, (divine portent!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which the achaeans sacrificed to jove the lord of omens; when,</p>
    <p class=l>)<br />high o’er the wondering hosts he soar’d above,<br />who paid their vows to panomphaean jove;<br />then let the prey before his altar fall;<br />the greeks beheld, and transport seized on all:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, the people saw that the bird had come from jove, they</p>
    <p class=l>encouraged by the sign, the troops revive,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sprang more fiercely upon the trojans and fought more boldly.</p>
    <p class=l>and fierce on troy with doubled fury drive.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there was no man of all the many danaans who could then boast</p>
    <p class=l>tydides first, of all the grecian force,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that he had driven his horses over the trench and gone forth to</p>
    <p class=l>o’er the broad ditch impell’d his foaming horse,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight sooner than the son of tydeus; long before any one else</p>
    <p class=l>pierced the deep ranks, their strongest battle tore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>could do so he slew an armed warrior of the trojans, agelaus the</p>
    <p class=l>and dyed his javelin red with trojan gore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of phradmon.</p>
    <p class=l>young agelaus (phradmon was his sire)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he had turned his horses in flight, but the</p>
    <p class=l>with flying coursers shunn’d his dreadful ire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear struck him in the back midway between his shoulders and</p>
    <p class=l>struck through the back, the phrygian fell oppress’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went right through his chest, and his armour rang rattling round</p>
    <p class=l>the dart drove on, and issued at his breast:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him as he fell forward from his chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>headlong he quits the car: his arms resound;<br />his ponderous buckler thunders on the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after him came agamemnon and menelaus, sons of atreus, the two</p>
    <p class=l>forth rush a tide of greeks, the passage freed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajaxes clothed in valour as with a garment, idomeneus and his</p>
    <p class=l>the atridae first, the ajaces next succeed:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>companion in arms meriones, peer of murderous mars, and eurypylus</p>
    <p class=l>meriones, like mars in arms renown’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the brave son of euaemon.</p>
    <p class=l>and godlike idomen, now passed the mound;<br />evaemon’s son next issues to the foe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ninth came teucer with his bow, and</p>
    <p class=l>and last young teucer with his bended bow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>took his place under cover of the shield of ajax son of telamon.</p>
    <p class=l>secure behind the telamonian shield</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when ajax lifted his shield teucer would peer round, and when he</p>
    <p class=l>the skilful archer wide survey’d the field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had hit any one in the throng, the man would fall dead; then</p>
    <p class=l>with every shaft some hostile victim slew,<br />then close beneath the sevenfold orb withdrew:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>teucer would hie back to ajax as a child to its mother, and again</p>
    <p class=l>the conscious infant so, when fear alarms,<br />retires for safety to the mother’s arms.<br />thus ajax guards his brother in the field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>duck down under his shield.</p>
    <p class=l>moves as he moves, and turns the shining shield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which of the trojans did brave teucer first kill?</p>
    <p class=l>who first by teucer’s mortal arrows bled?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>orsilochus, and</p>
    <p class=l>orsilochus; then fell ormenus dead:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then ormenus and ophelestes, daetor, chromius, and godlike</p>
    <p class=l>the godlike lycophon next press’d the plain,<br />with chromius, daetor, ophelestes slain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lycophontes, amopaon son of polyaemon, and melanippus.</p>
    <p class=l>bold hamopaon breathless sunk to ground;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all these</p>
    <p class=l>the bloody pile great melanippus crown’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in turn did he lay low upon the earth, and king agamemnon was</p>
    <p class=l>heaps fell on heaps, sad trophies of his art,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glad when he saw him making havoc of the trojans with his mighty</p>
    <p class=l>a trojan ghost attending every dart.<br />great agamemnon views with joyful eye<br />the ranks grow thinner as his arrows fly:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bow.</p>
    <p class=l>“o youth forever dear!<br />(the monarch cried)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he went up to him and said, “teucer, man after my own heart,</p>
    <p class=l>thus, always thus, thy early worth be tried;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of telamon, captain among the host, shoot on, and be at once</p>
    <p class=l>thy brave example shall retrieve our host,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the saving of the danaans and the glory of your father telamon,</p>
    <p class=l>thy country’s saviour, and thy father’s boast!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who brought you up and took care of you in his own house when you</p>
    <p class=l>sprung from an alien’s bed thy sire to grace,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were a child, bastard though you were.</p>
    <p class=l>the vigorous offspring of a stolen embrace:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cover him with glory</p>
    <p class=l>proud of his boy, he own’d the generous flame,<br />and the brave son repays his cares with fame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>though he is far off; i will promise and i will assuredly</p>
    <p class=l>now hear a monarch’s vow: if heaven’s high powers</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>perform; if aegis-bearing jove and minerva grant me to sack the</p>
    <p class=l>give me to raze troy’s long-defended towers;<br />whatever treasures greece for me design,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>city of ilius, you shall have the next best meed of honour after</p>
    <p class=l>the next rich honorary gift be thine:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my own—a tripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a woman who</p>
    <p class=l>some golden tripod, or distinguished car,<br />with coursers dreadful in the ranks of war:<br />or some fair captive, whom thy eyes approve,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall go up into your bed.</p>
    <p class=l>shall recompense the warrior’s toils with love.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and teucer answered, “most noble son of atreus, you need not urge</p>
    <p class=l>to this the chief: “with praise the rest inspire,<br />nor urge a soul already fill’d with fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me; from the moment we began to drive them back to ilius, i have</p>
    <p class=l>what strength i have, be now in battle tried,<br />till every shaft in phrygian blood be dyed.<br />since rallying from our wall we forced the foe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>never ceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom i can</p>
    <p class=l>still aim’d at hector have i bent my bow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shoot and kill; i have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them</p>
    <p class=l>eight forky arrows from this hand have fled,<br />and eight bold heroes by their points lie dead:<br />but sure some god denies me to destroy</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have been buried in the flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog</p>
    <p class=l>this fury of the field, this dog of troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i cannot hit.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at hector, for he was</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and twang’d the string.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bent on hitting him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow</p>
    <p class=l>the weapon flies<br />at hector’s breast, and sings along the skies:<br />he miss’d the mark; but pierced gorgythio’s heart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hit priam’s brave son gorgythion in the breast.</p>
    <p class=l>and drench’d in royal blood the thirsty dart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his mother, fair</p>
    <p class=l>(fair castianira, nymph of form divine,<br />this offspring added to king priam’s line.<br />)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>castianeira, lovely as a goddess, had been married from aesyme,</p>
    <p class=l>as full-blown poppies, overcharged with rain,[196]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now he bowed his head as a garden poppy in full bloom when it</p>
    <p class=l>decline the head, and drooping kiss the plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is weighed down by showers in spring—even thus heavy bowed his</p>
    <p class=l>so sinks the youth: his beauteous head, depress’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>head beneath the weight of his helmet.</p>
    <p class=l>beneath his helmet, drops upon his breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>again he aimed at hector, for he was longing to hit him, and</p>
    <p class=l>another shaft the raging archer drew,<br />that other shaft with erring fury flew,<br />(from hector, phœbus turn’d the flying wound,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>again his arrow missed, for apollo turned it aside; but he hit</p>
    <p class=l>yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector’s brave charioteer archeptolemus in the breast, by the<br />nipple, as he was driving furiously into the fight.</p>
    <p class=l>thy breast, brave archeptolemus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the horses</p>
    <p class=l>it tore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>swerved aside as he fell headlong from the chariot, and there was</p>
    <p class=l>and dipp’d its feathers in no vulgar gore.<br />headlong he falls: his sudden fall alarms</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>no life left in him.</p>
    <p class=l>the steeds, that startle at his sounding arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector was greatly grieved at the loss of<br />his charioteer, but for all his sorrow he let him lie where he<br />fell, and bade his brother cebriones, who was hard by, take the</p>
    <p class=l>hector with grief his charioteer beheld</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>reins.</p>
    <p class=l>all pale and breathless on the sanguine field:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cebriones did as he had said.<br />hector thereon with a loud</p>
    <p class=l>then bids cebriones direct the rein,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cry sprang from his chariot to the ground, and seizing a great</p>
    <p class=l>quits his bright car, and issues on the plain.<br />dreadful he shouts: from earth a stone he took,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stone made straight for teucer with intent to kill him.</p>
    <p class=l>and rush’d on teucer with the lifted rock.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>teucer</p>
    <p class=l>the youth already strain’d the forceful yew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had just taken an arrow from his quiver and had laid it upon the</p>
    <p class=l>the shaft already to his shoulder drew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bowstring, but hector struck him with the jagged stone as he was<br />taking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder; he hit him</p>
    <p class=l>the feather in his hand, just wing’d for flight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>just where the collar-bone divides the neck from the chest, a</p>
    <p class=l>touch’d where the neck and hollow chest unite;<br />there, where the juncture knits the channel bone,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>very deadly place, and broke the sinew of his arm so that his</p>
    <p class=l>the furious chief discharged the craggy stone:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wrist was less, and the bow dropped from his hand as he fell</p>
    <p class=l>the bow-string burst beneath the ponderous blow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forward on his knees.</p>
    <p class=l>and his numb’d hand dismiss’d his useless bow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax saw that his brother had fallen, and</p>
    <p class=l>he fell: but ajax his broad shield display’d,<br />and screen’d his brother with the mighty shade;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>running towards him bestrode him and sheltered him with his</p>
    <p class=l>till great alaster, and mecistheus, bore</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shield.</p>
    <p class=l>the batter’d archer groaning to the shore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile his two trusty squires, mecisteus son of<br />echius, and alastor, came up and bore him to the ships groaning</p>
    <p class=l>troy yet found grace before the olympian sire,</p>

    <p class=l>he arm’d their hands, and fill’d their breasts with fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove now again put heart into the trojans, and they drove the</p>
    <p class=l>the greeks repulsed, retreat behind their wall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans to their deep trench with hector in all his glory at</p>
    <p class=l>or in the trench on heaps confusedly fall.<br />first of the foe, great hector march’d along,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their head.</p>
    <p class=l>with terror clothed, and more than mortal strong.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as a hound grips a wild boar or lion in flank or</p>
    <p class=l>as the bold hound, that gives the lion chase,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>buttock when he gives him chase, and watches warily for his</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wheeling, even so did hector follow close upon the achaeans, ever</p>
    <p class=l>guards as he turns, and circles as he wheels;<br />thus oft the grecians turn’d, but still they flew;<br />thus following, hector still the hindmost slew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>killing the hindmost as they rushed panic-stricken onwards.<br />when</p>
    <p class=l>when flying they had pass’d the trench profound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they had fled through the set stakes and trench and many achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>and many a chief lay gasping on the ground;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had been laid low at the hands of the trojans, they halted at<br />their ships, calling upon one another and praying every man</p>
    <p class=l>before the ships a desperate stand they made,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>instantly as they lifted up their hands to the gods; but hector</p>
    <p class=l>and fired the troops, and called the gods to aid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wheeled his horses this way and that, his eyes glaring like those</p>
    <p class=l>fierce on his rattling chariot hector came:<br />his eyes like gorgon shot a sanguine flame<br />that wither’d all their host: like mars he stood:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of gorgo or murderous mars.</p>
    <p class=l>dire as the monster, dreadful as the god!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>juno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said to</p>
    <p class=l>their strong distress the wife of jove survey’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva, “alas, child of aegis-bearing jove, shall you and i take</p>
    <p class=l>then pensive thus, to war’s triumphant maid:<br />“o daughter of that god, whose arm can wield<br />the avenging bolt, and shake the sable shield!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>no more thought for the dying danaans, though it be the last time</p>
    <p class=l>now, in this moment of her last despair,<br />shall wretched greece no more confess our care,<br />condemn’d to suffer the full force of fate,<br />and drain the dregs of heaven’s relentless hate?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we ever do so?</p>
    <p class=l>gods!<br />shall one raging hand thus level all?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see how they perish and come to a bad end before</p>
    <p class=l>what numbers fell!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the onset of but a single man.</p>
    <p class=l>what numbers yet shall fall!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector the son of priam rages with</p>
    <p class=l>what power divine shall hector’s wrath assuage?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>intolerable fury, and has already done great mischief.</p>
    <p class=l>still swells the slaughter, and still grows the rage!</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva answered, “would, indeed, this fellow might die in his</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove is mad with spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and</p>
    <p class=l>mocks our attempts, and slights our just demands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>unjust.</p>
    <p class=l>the stubborn god, inflexible and hard,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he forgets how often i saved his son when he was worn out</p>
    <p class=l>forgets my service and deserved reward:<br />saved i, for this, his favourite son distress’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by the labours eurystheus had laid on him.</p>
    <p class=l>by stern eurystheus with long labours press’d?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he would weep till his</p>
    <p class=l>he begg’d, with tears he begg’d, in deep dismay;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cry came up to heaven, and then jove would send me down to help</p>
    <p class=l>i shot from heaven, and gave his arm the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him; if i had had the sense to foresee all this, when eurystheus</p>
    <p class=l>oh had my wisdom known this dire event,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sent him to the house of hades, to fetch the hell-hound from</p>
    <p class=l>when to grim pluto’s gloomy gates he went;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>erebus, he would never have come back alive out of the deep</p>

    <p class=r>and now jove hates me, while he lets</p>

    <p class=r>his beard, when she was begging him to do honour to achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>to grace her gloomy, fierce, resenting son,</p>

    <p class=r>i</p>
    <p class=l>my hopes are frustrate, and my greeks undone.</p>

    <p class=r>shall know what to do next time he begins calling me his</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grey-eyed darling.</p>
    <p class=l>to call his blue-eyed maid his best beloved.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>get our horses ready, while i go within the</p>
    <p class=l>haste, launch thy chariot, through yon ranks to ride;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>house of aegis-bearing jove and put on my armour; we shall then</p>
    <p class=l>myself will arm, and thunder at thy side.<br />then, goddess!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>find out whether priam’s son hector will be glad to meet us in</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did she speak and white-armed juno, daughter of great</p>
    <p class=l>she ceased, and juno rein’d the steeds with care:<br />(heaven’s awful empress, saturn’s other heir:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saturn, obeyed her words; she set about harnessing her</p>
    <p class=l>pallas, meanwhile, her various veil unbound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gold-bedizened steeds, while minerva daughter of aegis-bearing</p>
    <p class=l>with flowers adorn’d, with art immortal crown’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove flung her richly vesture, made with her own hands, on to the</p>
    <p class=l>the radiant robe her sacred fingers wove<br />floats in rich waves, and spreads the court of jove.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>threshold of her father, and donned the shirt of jove, arming</p>
    <p class=l>her father’s arms her mighty limbs invest,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>herself for battle.</p>
    <p class=l>his cuirass blazes on her ample breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then she stepped into her flaming chariot,</p>
    <p class=l>the vigorous power the trembling car ascends:<br />shook by her arm, the massy javelin bends:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and grasped the spear so stout and sturdy and strong with which</p>
    <p class=l>huge, ponderous, strong!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her.</p>

    <p class=r>juno</p>
    <p class=l>proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o’erturns.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lashed her horses, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew</p>
    <p class=l>saturnia lends the lash; the coursers fly;<br />smooth glides the chariot through the liquid sky.<br />heaven’s gates spontaneous open to the powers,<br />heaven’s golden gates, kept by the winged hours.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>open of their own accord—gates over which the hours preside, in</p>
    <p class=l>commission’d in alternate watch they stand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whose hands are heaven and olympus, either to open the dense</p>
    <p class=l>the sun’s bright portals and the skies command;<br />close, or unfold, the eternal gates of day</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through these the goddesses<br />drove their obedient steeds.</p>
    <p class=l>prone down the steep of heaven their course they guide.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but father jove when he saw them from ida was very angry, and</p>
    <p class=l>but jove, incensed, from ida’s top survey’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sent winged iris with a message to them.</p>
    <p class=l>and thus enjoin’d the many-colour’d maid.<br />[illustration: ] juno and minerva going to assist the greeks</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pieces.</p>
    <p class=l>and hurl them flaming, headlong, to the ground,</p>

    <p class=l>the wounds impress’d by burning thunder deep.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then learn what quarrelling with her father means.</p>
    <p class=l>so shall minerva learn to fear our ire,</p>

    <p class=r>i am less</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heights</p>
    <p class=l>swift as the wind, the various-colour’d maid<br />from ida’s top her golden wings display’d;<br />to great olympus’ shining gate she flies,<br />there meets the chariot rushing down the skies,</p>

    <p class=l>restrains their progress from the bright abodes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she met the goddesses at<br />the outer gates of its many valleys and gave them her message.</p>
    <p class=l>and speaks the mandate of the sire of gods.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“what,” said she, “are you about?</p>
    <p class=l>“what frenzy goddesses!</p>

    <p class=r>them fast to their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they meant, and said, “minerva and juno, why are you so angry?</p>
    <p class=l>he saw their soul, and thus his word imparts:<br />“pallas and juno!<br />say, why heave your hearts?</p>

    <p class=r>the sun’s glorious orb now sank into</p>

    <p class=r>oceanus and drew down night over the land.</p>
    <p class=l>and drew behind the cloudy veil of night:</p>

    <p class=r>did darkness fall upon the achaeans.</p>

    <p class=r>council on the open space near the river, where there was a spot</p>
    <p class=l>a martial council near the navy walls;<br />these to scamander’s bank apart he led,</p>

    <p class=r>clear of corpses.</p>
    <p class=l>where thinly scatter’d lay the heaps of dead.</p>

    <p class=r>they left their chariots and sat down on the</p>

    <p class=r>he grasped a spear eleven</p>
    <p class=l>a massy spear he bore of mighty strength,<br />of full ten cubits was the lance’s length;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cubits long, the bronze point of which gleamed in front of it,</p>
    <p class=l>the point was brass, refulgent to behold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while the ring round the spear-head was of gold.</p>
    <p class=l>fix’d to the wood with circling rings of gold:</p>

    <p class=l>the noble hector on his lance reclined,</p>

    <p class=r>spoke.</p>
    <p class=l>and, bending forward, thus reveal’d his mind:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“hear me,” said he, “trojans, dardanians, and allies.</p>
    <p class=l>“ye valiant trojans, with attention hear!<br />ye dardan bands, and generous aids, give ear!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deemed but now that i should destroy the ships and all the</p>

    <p class=r>the sea-shore.</p>
    <p class=l>and guards them trembling in their wooden walls.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, therefore, let us obey the behests of night,</p>
    <p class=l>obey the night, and use her peaceful hours</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and prepare our suppers.</p>
    <p class=l>our steeds to forage, and refresh our powers.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>take your horses out of their chariots<br />and give them their feeds of corn; then make speed to bring sheep</p>

    <p class=r>and cattle from the city; bring wine also and corn for your</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>scatheless and unmolested; many a man among them must take a dart</p>

    <p class=r>hounds from our land, for ’tis the fates that have borne them and</p>
    <p class=l>from these detested foes to free the land,<br />who plough’d, with fates averse, the watery way:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their ships hither.</p>
    <p class=l>for trojan vultures a predestined prey.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this night, therefore, let us keep watch, but</p>
    <p class=l>our common safety must be now the care;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with early morning let us put on our armour and rouse fierce war</p>
    <p class=l>but soon as morning paints the fields of air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at the ships of the achaeans; i shall then know whether brave</p>
    <p class=l>sheathed in bright arms let every troop engage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed the son of tydeus will drive me back from the ships to the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i ween that at break of day, he shall be among</p>

    <p class=r>old, and of being worshipped like minerva and apollo, as i am</p>
    <p class=l>like pallas worshipp’d, like the sun renown’d!<br />as the next dawn, the last they shall enjoy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that this day will bring evil to the argives.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus spoke hector and the trojans shouted applause.</p>
    <p class=l>the leader spoke.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they took</p>
    <p class=l>from all his host around</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their sweating steeds from under the yoke, and made them fast</p>
    <p class=l>shouts of applause along the shores resound.<br />each from the yoke the smoking steeds untied,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>each by his own chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>and fix’d their headstalls to his chariot-side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they made haste to bring sheep and<br />cattle from the city, they brought wine also and corn from their</p>
    <p class=l>fat sheep and oxen from the town are led,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>houses and gathered much wood.</p>
    <p class=l>with generous wine, and all-sustaining bread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they then offered unblemished</p>
    <p class=l>full hecatombs lay burning on the shore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hecatombs to the immortals, and the wind carried the sweet savour</p>
    <p class=l>the winds to heaven the curling vapours bore.<br />ungrateful offering to the immortal powers!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of sacrifice to heaven—but the blessed gods partook not thereof,</p>
    <p class=l>[197]<br />whose wrath hung heavy o’er the trojan towers:<br />nor priam nor his sons obtain’d their grace;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for they bitterly hated ilius with priam and priam’s people.</p>
    <p class=l>proud troy they hated, and her guilty race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus<br />high in hope they sat through the livelong night by the highways</p>
    <p class=l>the troops exulting sat in order round,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of war, and many a watchfire did they kindle.</p>
    <p class=l>and beaming fires illumined all the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when the stars</p>
    <p class=l>as when the moon, refulgent lamp of night,[198]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shine clear, and the moon is bright—there is not a breath of air,</p>
    <p class=l>o’er heaven’s pure azure spreads her sacred light,<br />when not a breath disturbs the deep serene,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not a peak nor glade nor jutting headland but it stands out in</p>
    <p class=l>and not a cloud o’ercasts the solemn scene,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ineffable radiance that breaks from the serene of heaven; the</p>
    <p class=l>around her throne the vivid planets roll,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stars can all of them be told and the heart of the shepherd is</p>
    <p class=l>and stars unnumber’d gild the glowing pole,<br />o’er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed,<br />and tip with silver every mountain’s head:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glad—even thus shone the watchfires of the trojans before ilius</p>
    <p class=l>then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise,<br />a flood of glory bursts from all the skies:<br />the conscious swains, rejoicing in the sight,<br />eye the blue vault, and bless the useful light.<br />so many flames before proud ilion blaze,<br />and lighten glimmering xanthus with their rays.<br />the long reflections of the distant fires</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>midway between the ships and the river xanthus.</p>
    <p class=l>gleam on the walls, and tremble on the spires.</p>

    <p class=r>a thousand</p>
    <p class=l>a thousand piles the dusky horrors gild,</p>

    <p class=r>camp-fires gleamed upon the plain, and in the glow of each there</p>
    <p class=l>and shoot a shady lustre o’er the field.<br />full fifty guards each flaming pile attend,<br />whose umber’d arms, by fits, thick flashes send,</p>

    <p class=l>loud neigh the coursers o’er their heaps of corn,</p>

    <p class=r>all of them in despair.</p>
    <p class=l>sat on each face, and sadden’d every heart.</p>

    <p class=r>as when the two winds that blow from</p>
    <p class=l>as from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,</p>

    <p class=l>such various passions urged the troubled host,</p>

    <p class=r>the son of atreus in dismay bade the heralds call the people to a</p>

    <p class=r>haste also himself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in</p>

    <p class=l>the king amidst the mournful circle rose:</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=r>a heavy sigh he spoke to the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>in sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.<br />with more than vulgar grief he stood oppress’d;<br />words, mix’d with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>he said: deep silence held the grecian band;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sorrowful there, but they all held their peace, till at last</p>

    <p class=r>diomed of the loud battle-cry made answer saying, “son of atreus,</p>

    <p class=r>aggrieved that i should do so.</p>

    <p class=r>but the</p>
    <p class=l>from whom our honours spring,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of scheming saturn endowed you by halves only.</p>
    <p class=l>the gods have made thee but by halves a king:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he gave you</p>
    <p class=l>they gave thee sceptres, and a wide command;<br />they gave dominion o’er the seas and land;</p>

    <p class=l>the noblest power that might the world control</p>

    <p class=r>highest both right and might he did not give you.</p>
    <p class=l>they gave thee not—a brave and virtuous soul.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sir, think you</p>
    <p class=l>is this a general’s voice, that would suggest</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that the sons of the achaeans are indeed as unwarlike and</p>
    <p class=l>fears like his own to every grecian breast?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cowardly as you say they are?</p>
    <p class=l>confiding in our want of worth, he stands;</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sons of the achaeans shouted applause at the words of diomed,</p>
    <p class=l>he ceased; the greeks loud acclamations raise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and presently nestor rose to speak.</p>
    <p class=l>and voice to voice resounds tydides’ praise.<br />wise nestor then his reverend figure rear’d;</p>

    <p class=r>who are of your own years; no one of the achaeans can make light</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>youngest of my own children—still you have spoken wisely and have</p>
    <p class=l>and blame even kings with praise, because with truth.<br />and yet those years that since thy birth have run<br />would hardly style thee nestor’s youngest son.<br />then let me add what yet remains behind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>counselled the chief of the achaeans not without discretion;</p>
    <p class=l>a thought unfinish’d in that generous mind;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevertheless i am older than you and i will tell you everything;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore let no man, not even king agamemnon, disregard my</p>
    <p class=l>nor shall the advice i bring<br />distaste the people, or offend the king:<br />“cursed is the man, and void of law and right,<br />unworthy property, unworthy light,<br />unfit for public rule, or private care,</p>

    <p class=l>between the trench and wall let guards remain:</p>

    <p class=l>wise, weighty counsels aid a state distress’d,<br />and such a monarch as can choose the best.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sorely do we need shrewd and prudent counsel, for the foe has lit</p>

    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>swift through the gates the guards direct their way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sentinels went out in their armour under command of nestor’s son</p>
    <p class=l>his son was first to pass the lofty mound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thrasymedes, a captain of the host, and of the bold warriors</p>
    <p class=l>the generous thrasymed, in arms renown’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ascalaphus and ialmenus: there were also meriones, aphareus and</p>
    <p class=l>next him, ascalaphus, iälmen, stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deipyrus, and the son of creion, noble lycomedes.</p>
    <p class=l>the double offspring of the warrior-god:<br />deipyrus, aphareus, merion join,<br />and lycomed of creon’s noble line.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there were</p>
    <p class=l>seven were the leaders of the nightly bands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seven captains of the sentinels, and with each there went a</p>
    <p class=l>and each bold chief a hundred spears commands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hundred youths armed with long spears: they took their places</p>
    <p class=l>the fires they light, to short repasts they fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>midway between the trench and the wall, and when they had done so<br />they lit their fires and got every man his supper.</p>
    <p class=l>some line the trench, and others man the wall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of atreus then bade many councillors of the achaeans to</p>
    <p class=l>the king of men, on public counsels bent,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his quarters and prepared a great feast in their honour.</p>
    <p class=l>convened the princes in his ample tent,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they</p>
    <p class=l>each seized a portion of the kingly feast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as</p>
    <p class=l>but stay’d his hand when thirst and hunger ceased.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>soon as they had enough to eat and drink, old nestor, whose</p>
    <p class=l>then nestor spoke, for wisdom long approved,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>counsel was ever truest, was the first to lay his mind before</p>
    <p class=l>and slowly rising, thus the council moved.</p>

    <p class=r>them.</p>

    <p class=r>conciliate him.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and king agamemnon answered, “sir, you have reproved my folly<br />justly.</p>

    <p class=r>when he saw the strangers, rose also.</p>

    <p class=l>with that, the chiefs beneath his roof he led,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with purple rugs; then he said to patroclus who was close by him,</p>
    <p class=l>and placed in seats with purple carpets spread.</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=r>patroclus did as his comrade bade him; he set the chopping-block<br />in front of the fire, and on it he laid the loin of a sheep, the</p>
    <p class=l>he said: patroclus o’er the blazing fire</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>loin also of a goat, and the chine of a fat hog.</p>

    <p class=l>which flesh of porker, sheep, and goat contains.<br />achilles at the genial feast presides,<br />the parts transfixes, and with skill divides.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>put them on spits while the son of menoetius made the fire burn</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>high.</p>
    <p class=l>the tent is brighten’d with the rising blaze:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the flame had died down, he spread the embers, laid</p>
    <p class=l>then, when the languid flames at length subside,<br />he strows a bed of glowing embers wide,</p>

    <p class=r>the spits on top of them, lifting them up and setting them upon</p>
    <p class=l>above the coals the smoking fragments turns</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the spit-racks; and he sprinkled them with salt.</p>
    <p class=l>and sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the meat<br />was roasted, he set it on platters, and handed bread round the</p>
    <p class=l>with bread the glittering canisters they load,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>table in fair baskets, while achilles dealt them their portions.</p>
    <p class=l>which round the board menoetius’ son bestow’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then achilles took his seat facing ulysses against the opposite</p>
    <p class=l>himself, opposed to ulysses full in sight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wall, and bade his comrade patroclus offer sacrifice to the gods;</p>
    <p class=l>each portion parts, and orders every rite.<br />the first fat offering to the immortals due,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so he cast the offerings into the fire, and they laid their hands<br />upon the good things that were before them.</p>
    <p class=l>amidst the greedy flames patroclus threw;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as soon as they had</p>
    <p class=l>then each, indulging in the social feast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had enough to eat and drink, ajax made a sign to phoenix, and</p>
    <p class=l>his thirst and hunger soberly repress’d.<br />that done, to phœnix ajax gave the sign:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he saw this, ulysses filled his cup with wine and pledged</p>
    <p class=l>not unperceived; ulysses crown’d with wine<br />the foaming bowl, and instant thus began,<br />his speech addressing to the godlike man.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may take the one of your choice, freely and without gifts of</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wooing, to the house of peleus; he will add such dower to boot as</p>
    <p class=l>himself will give the dower; so vast a store</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>no man ever yet gave his daughter, and will give you seven</p>
    <p class=l>as never father gave a child before.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>well-established cities, cardamyle, enope, and hire where there</p>

    <p class=r>their hands.</p>
    <p class=l>if no regard thy suffering country claim,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you formal notice plainly and in all fixity of purpose that there</p>
    <p class=l>let greece then know, my purpose i retain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be no more of this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come.</p>
    <p class=l>nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him do i hate even as the gates of hell who says one thing while</p>
    <p class=l>who dares think one thing, and another tell,<br />my heart detests him as the gates of hell.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he hides another in his heart; therefore i will say what i mean.</p>
    <p class=l>“then thus in short my fix’d resolves attend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will be appeased neither by agamemnon son of atreus nor by any</p>
    <p class=l>which nor atrides nor his greeks can bend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>other of the danaans, for i see that i have no thanks for all my</p>
    <p class=l>long toils, long perils in their cause i bore,<br />but now the unfruitful glories charm no more.</p>

    <p class=r>coward and hero are held in equal honour, and death deals like</p>

    <p class=l>alike regretted in the dust he lies,<br />who yields ignobly, or who bravely dies.</p>

    <p class=r>i have taken</p>
    <p class=l>of all my dangers, all my glorious pains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nothing by all my hardships—with my life ever in my hand; as a</p>

    <p class=r>bird when she has found a morsel takes it to her nestlings, and</p>
    <p class=l>as the bold bird her helpless young attends,<br />from danger guards them, and from want defends;<br />in search of prey she wings the spacious air,<br />and with the untasted food supplies her care:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>herself fares hardly, even so many a long night have i been<br />wakeful, and many a bloody battle have i waged by day against</p>
    <p class=l>for thankless greece such hardships have i braved,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>those who were fighting for their women.</p>
    <p class=l>her wives, her infants, by my labours saved;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with my ships i have</p>
    <p class=l>long sleepless nights in heavy arms i stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>taken twelve cities, and eleven round about troy have i stormed</p>
    <p class=l>and sweat laborious days in dust and blood.<br />i sack’d twelve ample cities on the main,[207]<br />and twelve lay smoking on the trojan plain:<br />then at atrides’ haughty feet were laid</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with my men by land; i took great store of wealth from every one</p>
    <p class=l>the wealth i gathered, and the spoils i made.<br />your mighty monarch these in peace possess’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of them, but i gave all up to agamemnon son of atreus.</p>
    <p class=l>some few my soldiers had, himself the rest.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he stayed</p>
    <p class=l>some present, too, to every prince was paid;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>where he was by his ships, yet of what came to him he gave</p>
    <p class=l>and every prince enjoys the gift he made:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>little, and kept much himself.</p>
    <p class=l>i only must refund, of all his train;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“nevertheless he did distribute some meeds of honour among the</p>
    <p class=l>see what pre-eminence our merits gain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chieftains and kings, and these have them still; from me alone of</p>
    <p class=l>my spoil alone his greedy soul delights:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans did he take the woman in whom i delighted—let him</p>
    <p class=l>my spouse alone must bless his lustful nights:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>keep her and sleep with her.</p>
    <p class=l>the woman, let him (as he may) enjoy;</p>

    <p class=l>but what’s the quarrel, then, of greece to troy?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what made the son of atreus gather the host<br />and bring them?</p>
    <p class=l>what to these shores the assembled nations draws,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was it not for the sake of helen?</p>
    <p class=l>what calls for vengeance but a woman’s cause?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus the only men in the world who love their wives?</p>
    <p class=l>beloved by none but those of atreus’ race?<br />the wife whom choice and passion doth approve,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>any man of<br />common right feeling will love and cherish her who is his own, as<br />i this woman, with my whole heart, though she was but a fruitling</p>
    <p class=l>sure every wise and worthy man will love.</p>

    <p class=r>of my spear.</p>
    <p class=l>nor did my fair one less distinction claim;</p>

    <p class=l>slave as she was, my soul adored the dame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>false; i know him; let him tempt me no further, for he shall not</p>
    <p class=l>wrong’d in my love, all proffers i disdain;<br />deceived for once, i trust not kings again.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>move me.</p>
    <p class=l>ye have my answer—what remains to do,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let him look to you, ulysses, and to the other princes</p>
    <p class=l>your king, ulysses, may consult with you.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to save his ships from burning.</p>
    <p class=l>what needs he the defence this arm can make?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he has done much without me</p>
    <p class=l>has he not walls no human force can shake?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>already.</p>
    <p class=l>has he not fenced his guarded navy round</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he has built a wall; he has dug a trench deep and wide</p>
    <p class=l>with piles, with ramparts, and a trench profound?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all round it, and he has planted it within with stakes; but even</p>
    <p class=l>and will not these (the wonders he has done)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so he stays not the murderous might of hector.</p>
    <p class=l>repel the rage of priam’s single son?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so long as i</p>
    <p class=l>there was a time (’twas when for greece i fought)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fought the achaeans hector suffered not the battle range far from</p>
    <p class=l>when hector’s prowess no such wonders wrought;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the city walls; he would come to the scaean gates and to the oak</p>
    <p class=l>he kept the verge of troy, nor dared to wait</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tree, but no further.</p>
    <p class=l>achilles’ fury at the scæan gate;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>once he stayed to meet me and hardly did he</p>
    <p class=l>he tried it once, and scarce was saved by fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>escape my onset: now, however, since i am in no mood to fight</p>
    <p class=l>but now those ancient enmities are o’er;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him, i will to-morrow offer sacrifice to jove and to all the</p>
    <p class=l>to-morrow we the favouring gods implore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gods; i will draw my ships into the water and then victual them<br />duly; to-morrow morning, if you care to look, you will see my<br />ships on the hellespont, and my men rowing out to sea with might</p>
    <p class=l>then shall you see our parting vessels crown’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and main.</p>
    <p class=l>and hear with oars the hellespont resound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if great neptune vouchsafes me a fair passage, in three</p>
    <p class=l>the third day hence shall pythia greet our sails,[208]<br />if mighty neptune send propitious gales;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>days i shall be in phthia.</p>
    <p class=l>pythia to her achilles shall restore</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have much there that i left behind</p>
    <p class=l>the wealth he left for this detested shore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me when i came here to my sorrow, and i shall bring back still</p>
    <p class=l>thither the spoils of this long war shall pass,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>further store of gold, of red copper, of fair women, and of iron,</p>
    <p class=l>the ruddy gold, the steel, and shining brass:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my share of the spoils that we have taken; but one prize, he who</p>
    <p class=l>my beauteous captives thither i’ll convey,<br />and all that rests of my unravish’d prey.<br />one only valued gift your tyrant gave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gave has insolently taken away.</p>
    <p class=l>and that resumed—the fair lyrnessian slave.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tell him all as i now bid you,</p>
    <p class=l>then tell him: loud, that all the greeks may hear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and tell him in public that the achaeans may hate him and beware</p>
    <p class=l>and learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of him should he think that he can yet dupe others for his</p>
    <p class=l>(for arm’d in impudence, mankind he braves,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>effrontery never fails him.</p>
    <p class=l>and meditates new cheats on all his slaves;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“as for me, hound that he is, he dares not look me in the face.</p>
    <p class=l>though shameless as he is, to face these eyes<br />is what he dares not: if he dares he dies;)</p>

    <p class=l>tell him, all terms, all commerce i decline,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will take no counsel with him, and will undertake nothing in<br />common with him.</p>
    <p class=l>nor share his council, nor his battle join;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he has wronged me and deceived me enough, he</p>
    <p class=l>for once deceiv’d, was his; but twice were mine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall not cozen me further; let him go his own way, for jove has</p>
    <p class=l>no—let the stupid prince, whom jove deprives</p>

    <p class=r>robbed him of his reason.</p>
    <p class=l>of sense and justice, run where frenzy drives;</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>stand but as slaves before a noble mind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he may offer me ten or even twenty times what<br />he has now done, nay—not though it be all that he has in the</p>
    <p class=l>not though he proffer’d all himself possess’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>world, both now or ever shall have; he may promise me the wealth</p>
    <p class=l>and all his rapine could from others wrest:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of orchomenus or of egyptian thebes, which is the richest city in</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the whole world, for it has a hundred gates through each of which</p>
    <p class=l>(that spreads her conquests o’er a thousand states,<br />and pours her heroes through a hundred gates,<br />two hundred horsemen and two hundred cars<br />from each wide portal issuing to the wars);[210]</p>

    <p class=l>though bribes were heap’d on bribes, in number more</p>

    <hr />

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which</p>
    <p class=l>the son of peleus ceased: the chiefs around<br />in silence wrapt, in consternation drown’d,<br />attend the stern reply.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he had denied them, till presently the old knight phoenix in his</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great fear for the ships of the achaeans, burst into tears and</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said, “noble achilles, if you are now minded to return, and in</p>

    <p class=r>the fierceness of your anger will do nothing to save the ships</p>
    <p class=l>and leave our hosts in blood, our fleets on fire?<br />if wrath so dreadful fill thy ruthless mind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from burning, how, my son, can i remain here without you?</p>
    <p class=l>how shall thy friend, thy phœnix, stay behind?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your</p>
    <p class=l>the royal peleus, when from pythia’s coast</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father peleus bade me go with you when he sent you as a mere lad</p>
    <p class=l>he sent thee early to the achaian host;<br />thy youth as then in sage debates unskill’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from phthia to agamemnon.</p>
    <p class=l>and new to perils of the direful field:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you knew nothing neither of war nor of</p>
    <p class=l>he bade me teach thee all the ways of war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the arts whereby men make their mark in council, and he sent me<br />with you to train you in all excellence of speech and action.</p>
    <p class=l>to shine in councils, and in camps to dare.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, my son, i will not stay here without you—no, not</p>
    <p class=l>never, ah, never let me leave thy side!<br />no time shall part us, and no fate divide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>though heaven itself vouchsafe to strip my years from off me, and</p>
    <p class=l>not though the god, that breathed my life, restore<br />the bloom i boasted, and the port i bore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>make me young as i was when i first left hellas the land of fair</p>
    <p class=l>when greece of old beheld my youthful flames</p>

    <p class=r>women.</p>
    <p class=l>(delightful greece, the land of lovely dames),</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i was then flying the anger of father amyntor, son of</p>
    <p class=l>my father faithless to my mother’s arms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ormenus, who was furious with me in the matter of his concubine,<br />of whom he was enamoured to the wronging of his wife my mother.</p>
    <p class=l>old as he was, adored a stranger’s charms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my mother, therefore, prayed me without ceasing to lie with the</p>
    <p class=l>i tried what youth could do (at her desire)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>woman myself, that so she hate my father, and in the course of<br />time i yielded.</p>
    <p class=l>to win the damsel, and prevent my sire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but my father soon came to know, and cursed me</p>
    <p class=l>my sire with curses loads my hated head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bitterly, calling the dread erinyes to witness.</p>
    <p class=l>and cries, ‘ye furies!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he prayed that no</p>
    <p class=l>barren be his bed.<br />’</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of mine might ever sit upon knees—and the gods, jove of the</p>
    <p class=l>infernal jove, the vengeful fiends below,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>world below and awful proserpine, fulfilled his curse.</p>
    <p class=l>and ruthless proserpine, confirm’d his vow.<br />despair and grief distract my labouring mind!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i took</p>
    <p class=l>gods!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>counsel to kill him, but some god stayed my rashness and bade me</p>
    <p class=l>what a crime my impious heart design’d!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>think on men’s evil tongues and how i should be branded as the</p>
    <p class=l>i thought (but some kind god that thought suppress’d)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>murderer of my father; nevertheless i could not bear to stay in<br />my father’s house with him so bitter against me.</p>
    <p class=l>to plunge the poniard in my father’s breast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my cousins and</p>
    <p class=l>then meditate my flight: my friends in vain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>clansmen came about me, and pressed me sorely to remain; many a</p>
    <p class=l>with prayers entreat me, and with force detain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sheep and many an ox did they slaughter, and many a fat hog did</p>
    <p class=l>on fat of rams, black bulls, and brawny swine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they set down to roast before the fire; many a jar, too, did they<br />broach of my father’s wine.</p>
    <p class=l>they daily feast, with draughts of fragrant wine;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nine whole nights did they set a</p>
    <p class=l>strong guards they placed, and watch’d nine nights entire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>guard over me taking it in turns to watch, and they kept a fire<br />always burning, both in the cloister of the outer court and in</p>
    <p class=l>the roofs and porches flamed with constant fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the inner court at the doors of the room wherein i lay; but when<br />the darkness of the tenth night came, i broke through the closed</p>
    <p class=l>the tenth, i forced the gates, unseen of all:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>doors of my room, and climbed the wall of the outer court after</p>
    <p class=l>and, favour’d by the night, o’erleap’d the wall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>passing quickly and unperceived through the men on guard and the</p>
    <p class=l>my travels thence through spacious greece extend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>women servants.<br />i then fled through hellas till i came to fertile</p>
    <p class=l>in phthia’s court at last my labours end.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>phthia, mother of sheep, and to king peleus, who made me welcome<br />and treated me as a father treats an only son who will be heir to</p>
    <p class=l>your sire received me, as his son caress’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all his wealth.</p>
    <p class=l>with gifts enrich’d, and with possessions bless’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he made me rich and set me over much people,<br />establishing me on the borders of phthia where i was chief ruler</p>
    <p class=l>the strong dolopians thenceforth own’d my reign,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over the dolopians.</p>
    <p class=l>and all the coast that runs along the main.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“it was i, achilles, who had the making of you; i loved you with</p>
    <p class=l>by love to thee his bounties i repaid,<br />and early wisdom to thy soul convey’d:<br />great as thou art, my lessons made thee brave:<br />a child i took thee, but a hero gave.<br />thy infant breast a like affection show’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all my heart: for you would eat neither at home nor when you had</p>
    <p class=l>still in my arms (an ever-pleasing load)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gone out elsewhere, till i had first set you upon my knees, cut</p>
    <p class=l>or at my knee, by phœnix wouldst thou stand;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>up the dainty morsel that you were to eat, and held the wine-cup</p>
    <p class=l>no food was grateful but from phœnix’ hand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to your lips.</p>
    <p class=l>[211]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many a time have you slobbered your wine in baby</p>
    <p class=l>i pass my watchings o’er thy helpless years,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>helplessness over my shirt; i had infinite trouble with you, but</p>
    <p class=l>the tender labours, the compliant cares,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i knew that heaven had vouchsafed me no offspring of my own, and</p>
    <p class=l>the gods (i thought) reversed their hard decree,<br />and phœnix felt a father’s joys in thee:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i made a son of you, achilles, that in my hour of need you might</p>
    <p class=l>thy growing virtues justified my cares,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>protect me.</p>
    <p class=l>and promised comfort to my silver hairs.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, therefore, i say battle with your pride and beat</p>
    <p class=l>now be thy rage, thy fatal rage, resign’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it; cherish not your anger for ever; the might and majesty of</p>
    <p class=l>a cruel heart ill suits a manly mind:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heaven are more than ours, but even heaven may be appeased; and</p>
    <p class=l>the gods (the only great, and only wise)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if a man has sinned he prays the gods, and reconciles them to</p>
    <p class=l>are moved by offerings, vows, and sacrifice;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>himself by his piteous cries and by frankincense, with</p>
    <p class=l>offending man their high compassion wins,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drink-offerings and the savour of burnt sacrifice.<br />for prayers</p>
    <p class=l>and daily prayers atone for daily sins.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are as daughters to great jove; halt, wrinkled, with eyes</p>
    <p class=l>prayers are jove’s daughters, of celestial race,<br />lame are their feet, and wrinkled is their face;<br />with humble mien, and with dejected eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>askance, they follow in the footsteps of sin, who, being fierce</p>
    <p class=l>constant they follow, where injustice flies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and fleet of foot, leaves them far behind him, and ever baneful</p>
    <p class=l>injustice swift, erect, and unconfined,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to mankind outstrips them even to the ends of the world; but</p>
    <p class=l>sweeps the wide earth, and tramples o’er mankind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevertheless the prayers come hobbling and healing after.</p>
    <p class=l>while prayers, to heal her wrongs, move slow behind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if a<br />man has pity upon these daughters of jove when they draw near</p>
    <p class=l>who hears these daughters of almighty jove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him, they will bless him and hear him too when he is praying; but</p>
    <p class=l>for him they mediate to the throne above:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if he deny them and will not listen to them, they go to jove the</p>
    <p class=l>when man rejects the humble suit they make,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of saturn and pray that he may presently fall into sin—to his</p>
    <p class=l>the sire revenges for the daughters’ sake;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ruing bitterly hereafter.</p>
    <p class=l>from jove commission’d, fierce injustice then<br />descends to punish unrelenting men.<br />o let not headlong passion bear the sway</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, achilles, give these</p>
    <p class=l>these reconciling goddesses obey:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>daughters of jove due reverence, and bow before them as all good</p>
    <p class=l>due honours to the seed of jove belong,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men will bow.</p>
    <p class=l>due honours calm the fierce, and bend the strong.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were not the son of atreus offering you gifts and</p>
    <p class=l>were these not paid thee by the terms we bring,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>promising others later—if he were still furious and implacable—i</p>
    <p class=l>were rage still harbour’d in the haughty king;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>am not he that would bid you throw off your anger and help the</p>
    <p class=l>nor greece nor all her fortunes should engage<br />thy friend to plead against so just a rage.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans, no matter how great their need; but he is giving much</p>
    <p class=l>but since what honour asks the general sends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, and more hereafter; he has sent his captains to urge his</p>
    <p class=l>and sends by those whom most thy heart commends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>suit, and has chosen those who of all the argives are most</p>
    <p class=l>the best and noblest of the grecian train;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>acceptable to you; make not then their words and their coming to<br />be of none effect.</p>
    <p class=l>permit not these to sue, and sue in vain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your anger has been righteous so far.</p>
    <p class=l>let me (my son) an ancient fact unfold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we have<br />heard in song how heroes of old time quarrelled when they were</p>
    <p class=l>a great example drawn from times of old;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>roused to fury, but still they could be won by gifts, and fair</p>
    <p class=l>hear what our fathers were, and what their praise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>words could soothe them.</p>
    <p class=l>who conquer’d their revenge in former days.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“i have an old story in my mind—a very old one—but you are all</p>
    <p class=l>“where calydon on rocky mountains stands[212]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>friends and i will tell it.<br />the curetes and the aetolians were<br />fighting and killing one another round calydon—the aetolians</p>
    <p class=l>once fought the ætolian and curetian bands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>defending the city and the curetes trying to destroy it.<br />for<br />diana of the golden throne was angry and did them hurt because<br />oeneus had not offered her his harvest first-fruits.</p>
    <p class=l>to guard it those; to conquer, these advance;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the other</p>
    <p class=l>and mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gods had all been feasted with hecatombs, but to the daughter of</p>
    <p class=l>the silver cynthia bade contention rise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great jove alone he had made no sacrifice.</p>
    <p class=l>in vengeance of neglected sacrifice;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he had forgotten her,<br />or somehow or other it had escaped him, and this was a grievous<br />sin.<br />thereon the archer goddess in her displeasure sent a<br />prodigious creature against him—a savage wild boar with great</p>
    <p class=l>on œneus fields she sent a monstrous boar,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>white tusks that did much harm to his orchard lands, uprooting<br />apple-trees in full bloom and throwing them to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>that levell’d harvests, and whole forests tore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but<br />meleager son of oeneus got huntsmen and hounds from many cities<br />and killed it—for it was so monstrous that not a few were needed,<br />and many a man did it stretch upon his funeral pyre.<br />on this the</p>
    <p class=l>this beast (when many a chief his tusks had slain)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>goddess set the curetes and the aetolians fighting furiously</p>
    <p class=l>great meleager stretch’d along the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about the head and skin of the boar.</p>
    <p class=l>then, for his spoils, a new debate arose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“so long as meleager was in the field things went badly with the</p>
    <p class=l>the neighbour nations thence commencing foes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>curetes, and for all their numbers they could not hold their</p>
    <p class=l>strong as they were, the bold curetes fail’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ground under the city walls; but in the course of time meleager</p>
    <p class=l>while meleager’s thundering arm prevail’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was angered as even a wise man will sometimes be.</p>
    <p class=l>till rage at length inflamed his lofty breast<br />(for rage invades the wisest and the best).</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was incensed</p>
    <p class=l>“cursed by althaea, to his wrath he yields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with his mother althaea, and therefore stayed at home with his</p>
    <p class=l>and in his wife’s embrace forgets the fields.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wedded wife fair cleopatra, who was daughter of marpessa daughter</p>
    <p class=l>(she from marpessa sprung, divinely fair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of euenus, and of ides the man then living.</p>
    <p class=l>and matchless idas, more than man in war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he it was who took</p>
    <p class=l>the god of day adored the mother’s charms;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his bow and faced king apollo himself for fair marpessa’s sake;</p>
    <p class=l>against the god the father bent his arms:<br />the afflicted pair, their sorrows to proclaim,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her father and mother then named her alcyone, because her mother</p>
    <p class=l>from cleopatra changed their daughter’s name,<br />and call’d alcyone; a name to show</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had mourned with the plaintive strains of the halcyon-bird when</p>
    <p class=l>the father’s grief, the mourning mother’s woe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>phoebus apollo had carried her off.</p>
    <p class=l>)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meleager, then, stayed at</p>
    <p class=l>to her the chief retired from stern debate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>home with cleopatra, nursing the anger which he felt by reason of</p>
    <p class=l>but found no peace from fierce althaea’s hate:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his mother’s curses.</p>
    <p class=l>althaea’s hate the unhappy warrior drew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his mother, grieving for the death of her</p>
    <p class=l>whose luckless hand his royal uncle slew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brother, prayed the gods, and beat the earth with her hands,<br />calling upon hades and on awful proserpine; she went down upon<br />her knees and her bosom was wet with tears as she prayed that</p>
    <p class=l>she beat the ground, and call’d the powers beneath</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they would kill her son—and erinys that walks in darkness and</p>
    <p class=l>on her own son to wreak her brother’s death;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>knows no ruth heard her from erebus.</p>
    <p class=l>hell heard her curses from the realms profound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“then was heard the din of battle about the gates of calydon, and</p>
    <p class=l>and the red fiends that walk the nightly round.<br />in vain ætolia her deliverer waits,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the dull thump of the battering against their walls.</p>
    <p class=l>war shakes her walls, and thunders at her gates.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon the</p>
    <p class=l>she sent ambassadors, a chosen band,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>elders of the aetolians besought meleager; they sent the chiefest</p>
    <p class=l>priests of the gods, and elders of the land;<br />besought the chief to save the sinking state:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of their priests, and begged him to come out and help them,<br />promising him a great reward.</p>
    <p class=l>their prayers were urgent, and their proffers great:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they bade him choose fifty<br />plough-gates, the most fertile in the plain of calydon, the</p>
    <p class=l>(full fifty acres of the richest ground,</p>

    <p class=r>one-half vineyard and the other open plough-land.</p>
    <p class=l>half pasture green, and half with vineyards crown’d:)</p>

    <p class=r>the old warrior<br />oeneus implored him, standing at the threshold of his room and<br />beating the doors in supplication.</p>
    <p class=l>his suppliant father, aged œneus, came;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his sisters and his mother</p>
    <p class=l>his sisters follow’d; even the vengeful dame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>herself besought him sore, but he the more refused them; those of</p>
    <p class=l>althaea, sues; his friends before him fall:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his comrades who were nearest and dearest to him also prayed him,</p>
    <p class=l>he stands relentless, and rejects them all.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but they could not move him till the foe was battering at the</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile the victor’s shouts ascend the skies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>very doors of his chamber, and the curetes had scaled the walls<br />and were setting fire to the city.</p>
    <p class=l>the walls are scaled; the rolling flames arise;</p>

    <p class=r>then at last his sorrowing</p>
    <p class=l>at length his wife (a form divine) appears,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wife detailed the horrors that befall those whose city is taken;</p>
    <p class=l>with piercing cries, and supplicating tears;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she reminded him how the men are slain, and the city is given</p>
    <p class=l>she paints the horrors of a conquer’d town,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over to the flames, while the women and children are carried into</p>
    <p class=l>the heroes slain, the palaces o’erthrown,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>captivity; when he heard all this, his heart was touched, and he</p>
    <p class=l>the matrons ravish’d, the whole race enslaved:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>donned his armour to go forth.</p>
    <p class=l>the warrior heard, he vanquish’d, and he saved.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus of his own inward motion he<br />saved the city of the aetolians; but they now gave him nothing of<br />those rich rewards that they had offered earlier, and though he</p>
    <p class=l>the ætolians, long disdain’d, now took their turn,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saved the city he took nothing by it.</p>
    <p class=l>and left the chief their broken faith to mourn.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be not then, my son, thus<br />minded; let not heaven lure you into any such course.<br />when the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships are burning it will be a harder matter to save them.</p>
    <p class=l>nor stay till yonder fleets ascend in fire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>take<br />the gifts, and go, for the achaeans will then honour you as a<br />god; whereas if you fight without taking them, you may beat the</p>
    <p class=l>accept the presents; draw thy conquering sword;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battle back, but you will not be held in like honour.</p>

    <p class=r>his ships into the water.</p>
    <p class=l>beneath his oars the whitening billows fly;</p>

    <p class=r>story—ajax and the two heralds, men, both of them, who may be<br />trusted.</p>
    <p class=l>these sacred heralds and great ajax heard.</p>

    <p class=r>they all held their peace, sitting for a long time silent and</p>
    <p class=l>ulysses ceased: the great achaian host,</p>

    <p class=r>dejected, by reason of the sternness with which achilles had</p>
    <p class=l>with sorrow seized, in consternation lost,<br />attend the stern reply.<br />tydides broke</p>

    <p class=r>refused them, till presently diomed said, “most noble son of</p>

    <p class=l>all but the king: with various thoughts oppress’d,[215]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he could get no rest.</p>
    <p class=l>his country’s cares lay rolling in his breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when fair juno’s lord flashes his</p>
    <p class=l>as when by lightnings jove’s ethereal power</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lightning in token of great rain or hail or snow when the</p>
    <p class=l>foretels the rattling hail, or weighty shower,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>snow-flakes whiten the ground, or again as a sign that he will</p>
    <p class=l>or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>open the wide jaws of hungry war, even so did agamemnon heave</p>
    <p class=l>or bids the brazen throat of war to roar;<br />by fits one flash succeeds as one expires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many a heavy sigh, for his soul trembled within him.</p>
    <p class=l>and heaven flames thick with momentary fires:<br />so bursting frequent from atrides’ breast,<br />sighs following sighs his inward fears confess’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he</p>
    <p class=l>now o’er the fields, dejected, he surveys</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>looked upon the plain of troy he marvelled at the many watchfires</p>
    <p class=l>from thousand trojan fires the mounting blaze;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>burning in front of ilius, and at the sound of pipes and flutes</p>
    <p class=l>hears in the passing wind their music blow,<br />and marks distinct the voices of the foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and of the hum of men, but when presently he turned towards the</p>
    <p class=l>now looking backwards to the fleet and coast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships and hosts of the achaeans, he tore his hair by handfuls</p>
    <p class=l>anxious he sorrows for the endangered host.<br />he rends his hair, in sacrifice to jove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>before jove on high, and groaned aloud for the very disquietness</p>
    <p class=l>and sues to him that ever lives above:<br />inly he groans; while glory and despair</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of his soul.</p>
    <p class=l>divide his heart, and wage a double war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the end he deemed it best to go at once to nestor</p>
    <p class=l>a thousand cares his labouring breast revolves;<br />to seek sage nestor now the chief resolves,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of neleus, and see if between them they could find any way of</p>
    <p class=l>with him, in wholesome counsels, to debate</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans from destruction.</p>
    <p class=l>what yet remains to save the afflicted state.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he therefore rose, put on his</p>
    <p class=l>he rose, and first he cast his mantle round,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shirt, bound his sandals about his comely feet, flung the skin of</p>
    <p class=l>next on his feet the shining sandals bound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a huge tawny lion over his shoulders—a skin that reached his</p>
    <p class=l>a lion’s yellow spoils his back conceal’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>feet—and took his spear in his hand.</p>
    <p class=l>his warlike hand a pointed javelin held.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neither could menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile his brother, press’d with equal woes,<br />alike denied the gifts of soft repose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>argives who for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to</p>
    <p class=l>laments for greece, that in his cause before</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>so much had suffer’d and must suffer more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he covered his broad back with the skin of a</p>
    <p class=l>a leopard’s spotted hide his shoulders spread:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spotted panther, put a casque of bronze upon his head, and took</p>
    <p class=l>a brazen helmet glitter’d on his head:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his spear in his brawny hand.<br />then he went to rouse his brother,</p>
    <p class=l>thus (with a javelin in his hand) he went</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who was by far the most powerful of the achaeans, and was</p>
    <p class=l>to wake atrides in the royal tent.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>honoured by the people as though he were a god.<br />he found him by</p>
    <p class=l>already waked, atrides he descried,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the stern of his ship already putting his goodly array about his</p>
    <p class=l>his armour buckling at his vessel’s side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shoulders, and right glad was he that his brother had come.<br />menelaus spoke first.</p>
    <p class=l>joyful they met; the spartan thus begun:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“why,” said he, “my dear brother, are you<br />thus arming?</p>
    <p class=l>“why puts my brother his bright armour on?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit</p>
    <p class=l>sends he some spy, amidst these silent hours,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans?</p>
    <p class=l>to try yon camp, and watch the trojan powers?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i greatly fear that no one will do you this service,</p>
    <p class=l>but say, what hero shall sustain that task?<br />such bold exploits uncommon courage ask;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and spy upon the enemy alone in the dead of night.</p>
    <p class=l>guideless, alone, through night’s dark shade to go,<br />and midst a hostile camp explore the foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it will be a<br />deed of great daring.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and king agamemnon answered, “menelaus, we both of us need shrewd</p>
    <p class=l>to whom the king: “in such distress we stand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his mind, and inclines towards hector’s sacrifices rather than</p>
    <p class=l>greece to preserve, is now no easy part,<br />but asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.<br />for jove, averse, our humble prayer denies,<br />and bows his head to hector’s sacrifice.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ours.<br />i never saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought</p>
    <p class=l>what eye has witness’d, or what ear believed,</p>

    <p class=r>such ruin in one day as hector has now wrought against the sons</p>
    <p class=l>in one great day, by one great arm achieved,<br />such wondrous deeds as hector’s hand has done,<br />and we beheld, the last revolving sun?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the achaeans—and that too of his own unaided self, for he is</p>
    <p class=l>what honours the beloved of jove adorn!</p>

    <p class=l>sprung from no god, and of no goddess born;</p>

    <p class=l>yet such his acts, as greeks unborn shall tell,</p>

    <p class=r>menelaus replied, “how do i take your meaning?</p>
    <p class=l>to whom the spartan: “these thy orders borne,</p>

    <p class=r>am i to stay with<br />them and wait your coming, or shall i return here as soon as i</p>
    <p class=l>say, shall i stay, or with despatch return?</p>

    <p class=r>” “wait,” answered king agamemnon, “for</p>
    <p class=l>“there shall thou stay, (the king of men replied,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there are so many paths about the camp that we might miss one</p>

    <p class=r>another.</p>

    <p class=r>call every man on your way, and bid him be stirring;</p>
    <p class=l>still, with your voice the slothful soldiers raise,</p>

    <p class=r>we must take our full share of toil, for at our birth jove laid</p>
    <p class=l>not titles here, but works, must prove our worth.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this heavy burden upon us.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and went</p>
    <p class=l>this said, each parted to his several cares:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on to nestor shepherd of his people.</p>
    <p class=l>the king to nestor’s sable ship repairs;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he found him sleeping in his</p>
    <p class=l>the sage protector of the greeks he found</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tent hard by his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him—his</p>
    <p class=l>stretch’d in his bed with all his arms around;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shield, his two spears and his helmet; beside him also lay the</p>
    <p class=l>the various-colour’d scarf, the shield he rears,<br />the shining helmet, and the pointed spears;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gleaming girdle with which the old man girded himself when he</p>
    <p class=l>the dreadful weapons of the warrior’s rage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>armed to lead his people into battle—for his age stayed him not.</p>
    <p class=l>that, old in arms, disdain’d the peace of age.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he raised himself on his elbow and looked up at agamemnon.</p>
    <p class=l>then, leaning on his hand his watchful head,<br />the hoary monarch raised his eyes and said:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“who<br />is it,” said he, “that goes thus about the host and the ships</p>
    <p class=l>“what art thou, speak, that on designs unknown,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alone and in the dead of night, when men are sleeping?</p>
    <p class=l>while others sleep, thus range the camp alone;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are you<br />looking for one of your mules or for some comrade?</p>
    <p class=l>seek’st thou some friend or nightly sentinel?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do not stand<br />there and say nothing, but speak.</p>
    <p class=l>stand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what is your business?<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and agamemnon answered, “nestor, son of neleus, honour to the</p>

    <p class=l>scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain,<br />and scarce my heart support its load of pain.</p>

    <p class=r>i am thus abroad because sleep sits not upon</p>
    <p class=l>no taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and without sure counsel; my heart beats as though it would leap</p>
    <p class=l>(since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>out of my body, and my limbs fail me.</p>

    <p class=l>tired with the toils of day and watch of night;</p>

    <p class=r>the enemy is encamped hard and we know</p>
    <p class=l>else may the sudden foe our works invade,</p>

    <p class=r>not but he may attack us by night.</p>
    <p class=l>so near, and favour’d by the gloomy shade.</p>

    <p class=r>nestor replied, “most noble son of atreus, king of men,</p>

    <p class=r>nestor knight of gerene answered, “ulysses, noble son of laertes,</p>
    <p class=l>“o prudent chief!<br />(the pylian sage replied)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>take it not amiss, for the achaeans are in great straits.</p>
    <p class=l>wise as thou art, be now thy wisdom tried:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come</p>
    <p class=l>whatever means of safety can be sought,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with me and let us wake some other, who may advise well with us</p>
    <p class=l>whatever counsels can inspire our thought,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whether we shall fight or fly.</p>
    <p class=l>whatever methods, or to fly or fight;<br />all, all depend on this important night!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about</p>
    <p class=l>he heard, return’d, and took his painted shield;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his shoulders and came out with them.</p>
    <p class=l>then join’d the chiefs, and follow’d through the field.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first they went to diomed<br />son of tydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour</p>
    <p class=l>without his tent, bold diomed they found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with his comrades sleeping round him and using their shields as</p>
    <p class=l>all sheathed in arms, his brave companions round:<br />each sunk in sleep, extended on the field,<br />his head reclining on his bossy shield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pillows; as for their spears, they stood upright on the spikes of<br />their butts that were driven into the ground, and the burnished</p>
    <p class=l>a wood of spears stood by, that, fix’d upright,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bronze flashed afar like the lightning of father jove.</p>
    <p class=l>shot from their flashing points a quivering light.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the hero</p>
    <p class=l>a bull’s black hide composed the hero’s bed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was sleeping upon the skin of an ox, with a piece of fine carpet<br />under his head; nestor went up to him and stirred him with his</p>
    <p class=l>a splendid carpet roll’d beneath his head.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heel to rouse him, upbraiding him and urging him to bestir</p>
    <p class=l>then, with his foot, old nestor gently shakes</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>himself.</p>
    <p class=l>the slumbering chief, and in these words awakes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“wake up,” he exclaimed, “son of tydeus.</p>
    <p class=l>“rise, son of tydeus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>how can you</p>
    <p class=l>to the brave and strong</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sleep on in this way?</p>
    <p class=l>rest seems inglorious, and the night too long.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can you not see that the trojans are</p>
    <p class=l>but sleep’st thou now, when from yon hill the foe</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>encamped on the brow of the plain hard by our ships, with but a<br />little space between us and them?</p>
    <p class=l>hangs o’er the fleet, and shades our walls below?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on these words diomed leaped up instantly and said, “old man,</p>
    <p class=l>at this, soft slumber from his eyelids fled;<br />the warrior saw the hoary chief, and said:<br />“wondrous old man!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your heart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labours.</p>
    <p class=l>whose soul no respite knows,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are there no younger men among the achaeans who could go about to</p>
    <p class=l>though years and honours bid thee seek repose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rouse the princes?</p>
    <p class=l>let younger greeks our sleeping warriors wake;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there is no tiring you.</p>
    <p class=l>ill fits thy age these toils to undertake.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and nestor knight of gerene made answer, “my son, all that you<br />have said is true.</p>
    <p class=l>“my friend, (he answered,) generous is thy care;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have good sons, and also much people who</p>
    <p class=l>these toils, my subjects and my sons might bear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>might call the chieftains, but the achaeans are in the gravest</p>
    <p class=l>their loyal thoughts and pious love conspire<br />to ease a sovereign and relieve a sire:<br />but now the last despair surrounds our host;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>danger; life and death are balanced as it were on the edge of a</p>
    <p class=l>no hour must pass, no moment must be lost;<br />each single greek, in this conclusive strife,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>razor.</p>
    <p class=l>stands on the sharpest edge of death or life:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>go then, for you are younger than i, and of your courtesy</p>
    <p class=l>yet, if my years thy kind regard engage,<br />employ thy youth as i employ my age;<br />succeed to these my cares, and rouse the rest;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rouse ajax and the fleet son of phyleus.</p>
    <p class=l>he serves me most, who serves his country best.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders—a</p>
    <p class=l>this said, the hero o’er his shoulders flung<br />a lion’s spoils, that to his ankles hung;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>skin that reached his feet—and grasped his spear.</p>
    <p class=l>then seized his ponderous lance, and strode along.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had</p>
    <p class=l>meges the bold, with ajax famed for speed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>roused the heroes, he brought them back with him; they then went</p>
    <p class=l>the warrior roused, and to the entrenchments lead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the round of those who were on guard, and found the captains not</p>
    <p class=l>and now the chiefs approach the nightly guard;<br />a wakeful squadron, each in arms prepared:<br />the unwearied watch their listening leaders keep,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sleeping at their posts but wakeful and sitting with their arms</p>
    <p class=l>and, couching close, repel invading sleep.<br />so faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about them.</p>
    <p class=l>with toil protected from the prowling train;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as sheep dogs that watch their flocks when they are</p>
    <p class=l>when the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yarded, and hear a wild beast coming through the mountain forest</p>
    <p class=l>springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold:<br />through breaking woods her rustling course they hear;<br />loud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>towards them—forthwith there is a hue and cry of dogs and men,</p>
    <p class=l>of hounds and men: they start, they gaze around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and slumber is broken—even so was sleep chased from the eyes of</p>
    <p class=l>watch every side, and turn to every sound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans as they kept the watches of the wicked night, for</p>
    <p class=l>thus watch’d the grecians, cautious of surprise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they turned constantly towards the plain whenever they heard any</p>
    <p class=l>each voice, each motion, drew their ears and eyes:<br />each step of passing feet increased the affright;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stir among the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>and hostile troy was ever full in sight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the old man was glad and bade them be of</p>
    <p class=l>nestor with joy the wakeful band survey’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>good cheer.</p>
    <p class=l>and thus accosted through the gloomy shade.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“watch on, my children,” said he, “and let not sleep</p>
    <p class=l>“’tis well, my sons!<br />your nightly cares employ;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>get hold upon you, lest our enemies triumph over us.</p>
    <p class=l>else must our host become the scorn of troy.<br />watch thus, and greece shall live.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>” the hero said;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of<br />the achaeans who had been called to the council.</p>
    <p class=l>then o’er the trench the following chieftains led.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones and the</p>
    <p class=l>his son, and godlike merion, march’d behind</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brave son of nestor went also, for the princes bade them.</p>
    <p class=l>(for these the princes to their council join’d).<br />the trenches pass’d, the assembled kings around</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when</p>
    <p class=l>in silent state the consistory crown’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were beyond the trench that was dug round the wall they held</p>
    <p class=l>a place there was, yet undefiled with gore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their meeting on the open ground where there was a space clear of</p>
    <p class=l>the spot where hector stopp’d his rage before;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>corpses, for it was here that when night fell hector had turned</p>
    <p class=l>when night descending, from his vengeful hand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>back from his onslaught on the argives.</p>
    <p class=l>reprieved the relics of the grecian band:<br />(the plain beside with mangled corps was spread,<br />and all his progress mark’d by heaps of dead:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they sat down, therefore,</p>
    <p class=l>there sat the mournful kings: when neleus’ son,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and held debate with one another.<br />nestor spoke first.</p>
    <p class=l>the council opening, in these words begun:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my friends,” said he, “is there any man bold</p>
    <p class=l>“is there (said he) a chief so greatly brave,<br />his life to hazard, and his country save?<br />lives there a man, who singly dares to go</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>enough to venture among the trojans, and cut off some straggler,</p>
    <p class=l>to yonder camp, or seize some straggling foe?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or bring us news of what the enemy mean to do whether they will</p>
    <p class=l>or favour’d by the night approach so near,<br />their speech, their counsels, and designs to hear?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stay here by the ships away from the city, or whether, now that<br />they have worsted the achaeans, they will retire within their</p>
    <p class=l>if to besiege our navies they prepare,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>walls.</p>
    <p class=l>or troy once more must be the seat of war?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if he could learn all this and come back safely here, his</p>
    <p class=l>this could he learn, and to our peers recite,<br />and pass unharm’d the dangers of the night;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fame would be high as heaven in the mouths of all men, and he</p>
    <p class=l>what fame were his through all succeeding days,<br />while phœbus shines, or men have tongues to praise!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would be rewarded richly; for the chiefs from all our ships would</p>
    <p class=l>what gifts his grateful country would bestow!<br />what must not greece to her deliverer owe?<br />a sable ewe each leader should provide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>each of them give him a black ewe with her lamb—which is a</p>
    <p class=l>with each a sable lambkin by her side;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>present of surpassing value—and he would be asked as a guest to</p>
    <p class=l>at every rite his share should be increased,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all feasts and clan-gatherings.</p>
    <p class=l>and his the foremost honours of the feast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they all held their peace, but diomed of the loud war-cry spoke</p>
    <p class=l>fear held them mute: alone, untaught to fear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saying, “nestor, gladly will i visit the host of the trojans over</p>
    <p class=l>tydides spoke—“the man you seek is here.<br />through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against us, but if another will go with me i shall do so in</p>
    <p class=l>some god within commands, and i obey.<br />but let some other chosen warrior join,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>greater confidence and comfort.</p>
    <p class=l>to raise my hopes, and second my design.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when two men are together, one of</p>
    <p class=l>by mutual confidence and mutual aid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them may see some opportunity which the other has not caught</p>
    <p class=l>great deeds are done, and great discoveries made;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sight of; if a man is alone he is less full of resource, and his</p>
    <p class=l>the wise new prudence from the wise acquire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wit is weaker.</p>
    <p class=l>and one brave hero fans another’s fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this several offered to go with diomed.</p>
    <p class=l>contending leaders at the word arose;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the two ajaxes,</p>
    <p class=l>each generous breast with emulation glows;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>servants of mars, meriones, and the son of nestor all wanted to</p>
    <p class=l>so brave a task each ajax strove to share,<br />bold merion strove, and nestor’s valiant heir;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>go, so did menelaus son of atreus; ulysses also wished to go</p>
    <p class=l>the spartan wish’d the second place to gain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among the host of the trojans, for he was ever full of daring,</p>
    <p class=l>and great ulysses wish’d, nor wish’d in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and thereon agamemnon king of men spoke thus: “diomed,” said he,</p>
    <p class=l>then thus the king of men the contest ends:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“son of tydeus, man after my own heart, choose your comrade for<br />yourself—take the best man of those that have offered, for many</p>
    <p class=l>“thou first of warriors, and thou best of friends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would now go with you.</p>
    <p class=l>undaunted diomed!<br />what chief to join</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do not through delicacy reject the better</p>
    <p class=l>in this great enterprise, is only thine.<br />just be thy choice, without affection made;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>man, and take the worst out of respect for his lineage, because</p>
    <p class=l>to birth, or office, no respect be paid;<br />let worth determine here.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he is of more royal blood.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>” the monarch spake,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he said this because he feared for menelaus.</p>
    <p class=l>and inly trembled for his brother’s sake.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed answered, “if</p>
    <p class=l>“then thus (the godlike diomed rejoin’d)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you bid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can i</p>
    <p class=l>my choice declares the impulse of my mind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fail to think of ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to</p>
    <p class=l>how can i doubt, while great ulysses stands</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>face all kinds of danger—and pallas minerva loves him well?</p>
    <p class=l>to lend his counsels and assist our hands?<br />a chief, whose safety is minerva’s care;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if he</p>
    <p class=l>so famed, so dreadful, in the works of war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were to go with me we should pass safely through fire itself, for</p>
    <p class=l>bless’d in his conduct, i no aid require;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he is quick to see and understand.</p>
    <p class=l>wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“son of tydeus,” replied ulysses, “say neither good nor ill about</p>
    <p class=l>“it fits thee not, before these chiefs of fame,<br />(replied the sage,) to praise me, or to blame:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me, for you are among argives who know me well.</p>
    <p class=l>praise from a friend, or censure from a foe,<br />are lost on hearers that our merits know.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us be going,</p>
    <p class=l>but let us haste—night rolls the hours away,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the night wanes and dawn is at hand.</p>
    <p class=l>the reddening orient shows the coming day,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the stars have gone</p>
    <p class=l>the stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forward, two-thirds of the night are already spent, and the third<br />is alone left us.</p>
    <p class=l>and of night’s empire but a third remains.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they then put on their armour.</p>
    <p class=l>thus having spoke, with generous ardour press’d,<br />in arms terrific their huge limbs they dress’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brave thrasymedes provided the son</p>
    <p class=l>a two-edged falchion thrasymed the brave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of tydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own at</p>
    <p class=l>and ample buckler, to tydides gave:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his ship) and on his head he set a helmet of bull’s hide without</p>
    <p class=l>then in a leathern helm he cased his head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>either peak or crest; it is called a skull-cap and is a common</p>
    <p class=l>short of its crest, and with no plume o’erspread:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>headgear.</p>
    <p class=l>(such as by youths unused to arms are worn:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones found a bow and quiver for ulysses, and on his</p>
    <p class=l>no spoils enrich it, and no studs adorn.<br />next him ulysses took a shining sword,<br />a bow and quiver, with bright arrows stored:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>head he set a leathern helmet that was lined with a strong<br />plaiting of leathern thongs, while on the outside it was thickly</p>
    <p class=l>a well-proved casque, with leather braces bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>studded with boar’s teeth, well and skilfully set into it; next</p>
    <p class=l>(thy gift, meriones,) his temples crown’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the head there was an inner lining of felt.</p>
    <p class=l>soft wool within; without, in order spread,[217]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this helmet had been</p>
    <p class=l>a boar’s white teeth grinn’d horrid o’er his head.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stolen by autolycus out of eleon when he broke into the house of<br />amyntor son of ormenus.</p>
    <p class=l>this from amyntor, rich ormenus’ son,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he gave it to amphidamas of cythera to</p>
    <p class=l>autolycus by fraudful rapine won,<br />and gave amphidamas; from him the prize</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>take to scandea, and amphidamas gave it as a guest-gift to molus,</p>
    <p class=l>molus received, the pledge of social ties;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who gave it to his son meriones; and now it was set upon the head</p>
    <p class=l>the helmet next by merion was possess’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of ulysses.</p>
    <p class=l>and now ulysses’ thoughtful temples press’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other</p>
    <p class=l>thus sheathed in arms, the council they forsake,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chieftains behind them.</p>
    <p class=l>and dark through paths oblique their progress take.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pallas minerva sent them a heron by the</p>
    <p class=l>just then, in sign she favour’d their intent,<br />a long-wing’d heron great minerva sent:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wayside upon their right hands; they could not see it for the</p>
    <p class=l>this, though surrounding shades obscured their view,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>darkness, but they heard its cry.</p>
    <p class=l>by the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses was glad when he heard</p>
    <p class=l>as from the right she soar’d, ulysses pray’d,</p>

    <p class=r>trojans.<br />”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then diomed of the loud war-cry also prayed: “hear me too,” said</p>
    <p class=l>then godlike diomed preferr’d his prayer:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he, “daughter of jove, unweariable; be with me even as you were</p>

    <p class=r>he left the achaeans by the banks of the river</p>
    <p class=l>of greece he left, and sought the theban towers,</p>

    <p class=r>great deeds of daring, for you were his ready helper.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus they prayed, and pallas minerva heard their prayer.<br />when</p>
    <p class=l>the heroes pray’d, and pallas from the skies</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they had done praying to the daughter of great jove, they went</p>
    <p class=l>accords their vow, succeeds their enterprise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their way like two lions prowling by night amid the armour and</p>
    <p class=l>now, like two lions panting for the prey,<br />with dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>blood-stained bodies of them that had fallen.</p>
    <p class=l>through the black horrors of the ensanguined plain,<br />through dust, through blood, o’er arms, and hills of slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neither again did hector let the trojans sleep; for he too called</p>
    <p class=l>nor less bold hector, and the sons of troy,<br />on high designs the wakeful hours employ;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the princes and councillors of the trojans that he might set his</p>
    <p class=l>the assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>counsel before them.</p>
    <p class=l>who thus the counsels of his breast proposed:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“is there one,” said he, “who for a great</p>
    <p class=l>“what glorious man, for high attempts prepared,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>reward will do me the service of which i will tell you?</p>
    <p class=l>dares greatly venture for a rich reward?<br />of yonder fleet a bold discovery make,<br />what watch they keep, and what resolves they take?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he shall</p>
    <p class=l>if now subdued they meditate their flight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be well paid if he will.</p>
    <p class=l>and, spent with toil, neglect the watch of night?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will give him a chariot and a couple<br />of horses, the fleetest that can be found at the ships of the<br />achaeans, if he will dare this thing; and he will win infinite<br />honour to boot; he must go to the ships and find out whether they</p>
    <p class=l>his be the chariot that shall please him most,</p>

    <p class=r>beaten them the achaeans design to fly, and through sheer</p>

    <p class=l>and his the glory to have served so well.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they all held their peace; but there was among the trojans a</p>
    <p class=l>a youth there was among the tribes of troy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>certain man named dolon, son of eumedes, the famous herald—a man</p>
    <p class=l>dolon his name, eumedes’ only boy,<br />(five girls beside the reverend herald told.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rich in gold and bronze.</p>
    <p class=l>)<br />rich was the son in brass, and rich in gold;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was ill-favoured, but a good runner,</p>
    <p class=l>not bless’d by nature with the charms of face,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and was an only son among five sisters.</p>
    <p class=l>but swift of foot, and matchless in the race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he it was that now<br />addressed the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>“hector!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“i, hector,” said he, “will to the ships</p>
    <p class=l>(he said) my courage bids me meet</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and will exploit them.</p>
    <p class=l>this high achievement, and explore the fleet:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but first hold up your sceptre and swear</p>
    <p class=l>but first exalt thy sceptre to the skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that you will give me the chariot, bedight with bronze, and the</p>
    <p class=l>and swear to grant me the demanded prize;<br />the immortal coursers, and the glittering car,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses that now carry the noble son of peleus.</p>
    <p class=l>that bear pelides through the ranks of war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will make you a</p>
    <p class=l>encouraged thus, no idle scout i go,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>good scout, and will not fail you.</p>
    <p class=l>fulfil thy wish, their whole intention know,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will go through the host<br />from one end to the other till i come to the ship of agamemnon,<br />where i take it the princes of the achaeans are now consulting</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whether they shall fight or fly.</p>
    <p class=l>and all their counsels, all their aims betray.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had done speaking hector held up his sceptre, and swore</p>
    <p class=l>the chief then heaved the golden sceptre high,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him his oath saying, “may jove the thundering husband of juno</p>
    <p class=l>attesting thus the monarch of the sky:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bear witness that no other trojan but yourself shall mount those</p>
    <p class=l>“be witness thou!<br />immortal lord of all!<br />whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall:<br />by none but dolon shall this prize be borne,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>steeds, and that you shall have your will with them for ever.</p>
    <p class=l>and him alone the immortal steeds adorn.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the oath he swore was bootless, but it made dolon more keen on</p>
    <p class=l>thus hector swore: the gods were call’d in vain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>going.</p>
    <p class=l>but the rash youth prepares to scour the plain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he hung his bow over his shoulder, and as an overall he</p>
    <p class=l>across his back the bended bow he flung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wore the skin of a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of</p>
    <p class=l>a wolf’s grey hide around his shoulders hung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ferret skin.</p>
    <p class=l>a ferret’s downy fur his helmet lined,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he took a pointed javelin, and left the camp</p>
    <p class=l>and in his hand a pointed javelin shined.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the ships, but he was not to return with any news for hector.</p>
    <p class=l>then (never to return) he sought the shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had left the horses and the troops behind him, he made</p>
    <p class=l>and trod the path his feet must tread no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all speed on his way, but ulysses perceived his coming and said</p>
    <p class=l>scarce had he pass’d the steeds and trojan throng,<br />(still bending forward as he coursed along,)<br />when, on the hollow way, the approaching tread</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to diomed, “diomed, here is some one from the camp; i am not sure</p>
    <p class=l>ulysses mark’d, and thus to diomed;<br />“o friend!<br />i hear some step of hostile feet,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whether he is a spy, or whether it is some thief who would</p>
    <p class=l>moving this way, or hastening to the fleet;<br />some spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main;<br />or nightly pillager that strips the slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>plunder the bodies of the dead; let him get a little past us, we</p>
    <p class=l>yet let him pass, and win a little space;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can then spring upon him and take him.</p>
    <p class=l>then rush behind him, and prevent his pace.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if, however, he is too</p>
    <p class=l>but if too swift of foot he flies before,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quick for us, go after him with your spear and hem him in towards</p>
    <p class=l>confine his course along the fleet and shore,<br />betwixt the camp and him our spears employ,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ships away from the trojan camp, to prevent his getting back</p>
    <p class=l>and intercept his hoped return to troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to the town.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this they turned out of their way and lay down among the</p>
    <p class=l>with that they stepp’d aside, and stoop’d their head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>corpses.</p>
    <p class=l>(as dolon pass’d,) behind a heap of dead:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when</p>
    <p class=l>along the path the spy unwary flew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he had got about as far as the distance by which a mule-plowed</p>
    <p class=l>soft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue.<br />so distant they, and such the space between,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>furrow exceeds one that has been ploughed by oxen (for mules can</p>
    <p class=l>as when two teams of mules divide the green,<br />(to whom the hind like shares of land allows,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>plow fallow land quicker than oxen) they ran after him, and when</p>
    <p class=l>when now new furrows part the approaching ploughs.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he heard their footsteps he stood still, for he made sure they</p>
    <p class=l>now dolon, listening, heard them as they pass’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were friends from the trojan camp come by hector’s orders to bid</p>
    <p class=l>hector (he thought) had sent, and check’d his haste,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him return; when, however, they were only a spear’s cast, or<br />less, away from him, he saw that they were enemies and ran as</p>
    <p class=l>till scarce at distance of a javelin’s throw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fast as his legs could take him.</p>
    <p class=l>no voice succeeding, he perceived the foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the others gave chase at once,<br />and as a couple of well-trained hounds press forward after a doe</p>
    <p class=l>as when two skilful hounds the leveret wind;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or hare that runs screaming in front of them, even so did the son</p>
    <p class=l>or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of tydeus and ulysses pursue dolon and cut him off from his own</p>
    <p class=l>now lost, now seen, they intercept his way,<br />and from the herd still turn the flying prey:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>people.</p>
    <p class=l>so fast, and with such fears, the trojan flew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but when he had fled so far towards the ships that he</p>
    <p class=l>so close, so constant, the bold greeks pursue.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would soon have fallen in with the outposts, minerva infused</p>
    <p class=l>now almost on the fleet the dastard falls,<br />and mingles with the guards that watch the walls;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fresh strength into the son of tydeus for fear some other of the</p>
    <p class=l>when brave tydides stopp’d; a gen’rous thought</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans might have the glory of being first to hit him, and he</p>
    <p class=l>(inspired by pallas) in his bosom wrought,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>might himself be only second; he therefore sprang forward with</p>
    <p class=l>lest on the foe some forward greek advance,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his spear and said, “stand, or i shall throw my spear, and in</p>
    <p class=l>and snatch the glory from his lifted lance.<br />then thus aloud: “whoe’er thou art, remain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that case i shall soon make an end of you.</p>
    <p class=l>this javelin else shall fix thee to the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose.</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and high in air the weapon cast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the dart</p>
    <p class=l>which wilful err’d, and o’er his shoulder pass’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flew over the man’s right shoulder, and then stuck in the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>then fix’d in earth.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he stood stock still, trembling and in great fear; his teeth</p>
    <p class=l>against the trembling wood<br />the wretch stood propp’d, and quiver’d as he stood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chattered, and he turned pale with fear.</p>
    <p class=l>a sudden palsy seized his turning head;<br />his loose teeth chatter’d, and his colour fled;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the two came breathless</p>
    <p class=l>the panting warriors seize him as he stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>up to him and seized his hands, whereon he began to weep and</p>
    <p class=l>and with unmanly tears his life demands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said, “take me alive; i will ransom myself; we have great store</p>
    <p class=l>“o spare my youth, and for the breath i owe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from this my father will</p>
    <p class=l>large gifts of price my father shall bestow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>satisfy you with a very large ransom, should he hear of my being</p>
    <p class=l>vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alive at the ships of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>and steel well-temper’d and refulgent gold.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“fear not,” replied ulysses, “let no thought of death be in your</p>
    <p class=l>to whom ulysses made this wise reply:<br />“whoe’er thou art, be bold, nor fear to die.</p>

    <p class=l>what moves thee, say, when sleep has closed the sight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alone in the dead of night away from your camp and towards the<br />ships, while other men are sleeping?</p>
    <p class=l>to roam the silent fields in dead of night?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is it to plunder the bodies</p>
    <p class=l>cam’st thou the secrets of our camp to find,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the slain, or did hector send you to spy out what was going on</p>
    <p class=l>by hector prompted, or thy daring mind?<br />or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led,</p>

    <p class=r>at the ships?<br />or did you come here of your own mere notion?</p>

    <p class=r>dolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: “hector, with</p>

    <p class=l>much did he promise, rashly i believed:</p>

    <p class=r>he said he would give me the horses of the noble son of peleus</p>
    <p class=l>no less a bribe than great achilles’ car,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and his bronze-bedizened chariot; he bade me go through the</p>

    <p class=r>darkness of the flying night, get close to the enemy, and find</p>
    <p class=l>to learn what counsels, what resolves you take:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>out whether the ships are still guarded as heretofore, or<br />whether, now that we have beaten them, the achaeans design to<br />fly, and through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep their</p>
    <p class=l>if now subdued, you fix your hopes on flight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>watches.</p>
    <p class=l>and, tired with toils, neglect the watch of night.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses smiled at him and answered, “you had indeed set your</p>

    <p class=r>aeacus are hardly to be kept in hand or driven by any other</p>

    <p class=r>goddess of plunder, and prayed saying, “accept these, goddess,</p>

    <p class=l>this said, the spoils, with dropping gore defaced,<br />high on a spreading tamarisk he placed;</p>

    <p class=r>amid the fallen armour and the blood, and came presently to the</p>
    <p class=l>slippery with blood, o’er arms and heaps of shields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>company of thracian soldiers, who were sleeping, tired out with</p>
    <p class=l>arriving where the thracian squadrons lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their day’s toil; their goodly armour was lying on the ground</p>
    <p class=l>and eased in sleep the labours of the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beside them all orderly in three rows, and each man had his yoke</p>
    <p class=l>ranged in three lines they view the prostrate band:</p>

    <p class=l>the horses yoked beside each warrior stand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses from some way off saw him and said, “this,</p>
    <p class=l>the welcome sight ulysses first descries,<br />and points to diomed the tempting prize.</p>

    <p class=r>diomed, is the man, and these are the horses about which dolon</p>
    <p class=l>“the man, the coursers, and the car behold!<br />described by dolon, with the arms of gold.</p>

    <p class=r>thereon minerva put courage into the heart of diomed, and he</p>
    <p class=l>pallas (this said) her hero’s bosom warms,<br />breathed in his heart, and strung his nervous arms;<br />where’er he pass’d, a purple stream pursued<br />his thirsty falchion, fat with hostile blood,<br />bathed all his footsteps, dyed the fields with gore,</p>

    <p class=r>smote them right and left.</p>
    <p class=l>and a low groan remurmur’d through the shore.</p>

    <p class=r>were being hacked about, and the earth was red with their blood.</p>

    <p class=l>on sheep or goats, resistless in his way,</p>

    <p class=r>he finds them without their shepherd, so did the son of tydeus</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>frightened as they passed over the dead bodies, for they were not</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>killed him too (which made thirteen), as he was breathing hard,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for by the counsel of minerva an evil dream, the seed of oeneus,</p>
    <p class=l>just then a deathful dream minerva sent,<br />a warlike form appear’d before his tent,<br />whose visionary steel his bosom tore:<br />so dream’d the monarch, and awaked no more.</p>

    <p class=r>and congratulated them.<br />nestor knight of gerene was first to<br />question them.</p>
    <p class=l>they greet the kings; and nestor first demands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“tell me,” said he, “renowned ulysses, how did you</p>
    <p class=l>“say thou, whose praises all our host proclaim,<br />thou living glory of the grecian name!</p>

    <p class=r>two come by these horses?</p>
    <p class=l>say whence these coursers?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did you steal in among the trojan</p>
    <p class=l>by what chance bestow’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forces, or did some god meet you and give them to you?</p>
    <p class=l>the spoil of foes, or present of a god?</p>

    <p class=r>they are</p>
    <p class=l>not those fair steeds, so radiant and so gay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like sunbeams.</p>
    <p class=l>that draw the burning chariot of the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i am well conversant with the trojans, for old</p>

    <p class=r>yet saw or heard of such horses as these are.</p>
    <p class=l>like these, conspicuous through the ranks of fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>surely some god</p>
    <p class=l>some god, i deem, conferred the glorious prize,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>must have met you and given them to you, for you are both of you</p>
    <p class=l>bless’d as ye are, and favourites of the skies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dear to jove, and to jove’s daughter minerva.</p>

    <p class=r>and ulysses answered, “nestor son of neleus, honour to the</p>

    <p class=r>the other achaeans followed him gladly.</p>
    <p class=l>the joyful greeks with loud acclaim pursue.</p>

    <p class=r>when they reached the</p>

    <p class=r>they went into the sea and washed the sweat from their bodies,<br />and from their necks and thighs.</p>
    <p class=l>they cleanse their bodies in the neighb’ring main:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the sea-water had taken all<br />the sweat from off them, and had refreshed them, they went into<br />the baths and washed themselves.</p>
    <p class=l>then in the polished bath, refresh’d from toil,</p>

    <p class=r>after they had so done and had</p>

    <p class=r>leaves the field—hector then drives everything before him till he</p>
    <p class=l>agamemnon bears all before him and hector is<br />commanded by jupiter (who sends iris for that purpose) to decline the<br />engagement, till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field.<br />he then makes a great slaughter of the enemy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>light alike to mortals and immortals, jove sent fierce discord</p>
    <p class=l>with new-born day to gladden mortal sight,<br />and gild the courts of heaven with sacred light:<br />when baleful eris, sent by jove’s command,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with the ensign of war in her hands to the ships of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the torch of discord blazing in her hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she took her stand by the huge black hull of ulysses’ ship which</p>
    <p class=l>through the red skies her bloody sign extends,<br />and, wrapt in tempests, o’er the fleet descends.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was middlemost of all, so that her voice might carry farthest on</p>

    <p class=r>telamon, and on the other towards those of achilles—for these two</p>
    <p class=l>even ajax and achilles heard the sound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heroes, well assured of their own strength, had valorously drawn<br />up their ships at the two ends of the line.</p>
    <p class=l>whose ships, remote, the guarded navy bound,</p>

    <p class=r>there she took her</p>
    <p class=l>thence the black fury through the grecian throng</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stand, and raised a cry both loud and shrill that filled the</p>
    <p class=l>with horror sounds the loud orthian song:<br />the navy shakes, and at the dire alarms</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans with courage, giving them heart to fight resolutely and</p>
    <p class=l>each bosom boils, each warrior starts to arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with all their might, so that they had rather stay there and do</p>
    <p class=l>no more they sigh, inglorious to return,</p>

    <p class=r>battle than go home in their ships.</p>
    <p class=l>but breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.</p>

    <p class=r>first he girded</p>
    <p class=l>himself first rose, himself before the rest</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his goodly greaves about his legs, making them fast with</p>
    <p class=l>his mighty limbs in radiant armour dress’d,<br />and first he cased his manly legs around</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ankle-clasps of silver; and about his chest he set the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>breastplate which cinyras had once given him as a guest-gift.</p>

    <p class=r>about to sail for troy, and therefore he gave it to the king.</p>
    <p class=l>’twas then, the friendship of the chief to gain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it</p>
    <p class=l>this glorious gift he sent, nor sent in vain:)</p>

    <p class=l>ten rows of azure steel the work infold,<br />twice ten of tin, and twelve of ductile gold;</p>

    <p class=r>about his</p>
    <p class=l>a radiant baldric, o’er his shoulder tied,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shoulders he threw his sword, studded with bosses of gold; and</p>
    <p class=l>sustain’d the sword that glitter’d at his side:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the scabbard was of silver with a chain of gold wherewith to hang</p>
    <p class=l>gold was the hilt, a silver sheath encased</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it.</p>
    <p class=l>the shining blade, and golden hangers graced.</p>

    <p class=r>he took moreover the richly-dight shield that covered his</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body when he was in battle—fair to see, with ten circles of</p>
    <p class=l>that round the warrior cast a dreadful shade;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bronze running all round it.<br />on the body of the shield there were</p>
    <p class=l>ten zones of brass its ample brim surround,</p>

    <p class=r>twenty bosses of white tin, with another of dark cyanus in the</p>
    <p class=l>and twice ten bosses the bright convex crown’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>middle: this last was made to show a gorgon’s head, fierce and</p>
    <p class=l>tremendous gorgon frown’d upon its field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grim, with rout and panic on either side.</p>
    <p class=l>and circling terrors fill’d the expressive shield:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the band for the arm to</p>
    <p class=l>within its concave hung a silver thong,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>go through was of silver, on which there was a writhing snake of</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cyanus with three heads that sprang from a single neck, and went<br />in and out among one another.</p>
    <p class=l>till in three heads the embroider’d monster ends.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on his head agamemnon set a helmet,</p>
    <p class=l>last o’er his brows his fourfold helm he placed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with a peak before and behind, and four plumes of horse-hair that</p>
    <p class=l>with nodding horse-hair formidably graced;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nodded menacingly above it; then he grasped two redoubtable<br />bronze-shod spears, and the gleam of his armour shot from him as</p>
    <p class=l>and in his hands two steely javelins wields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a flame into the firmament, while juno and minerva thundered in</p>

    <p class=r>honour of the king of rich mycene.</p>
    <p class=l>in happy thunders promised greece their aid;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>every man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to hold</p>
    <p class=l>high o’er the chief they clash’d their arms in air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them in readiness by the trench, while he went into battle on</p>
    <p class=l>and, leaning from the clouds, expect the war.<br />close to the limits of the trench and mound,<br />the fiery coursers to their chariots bound</p>

    <p class=r>the dawning.</p>
    <p class=l>the lighter arms, rush forward to the field.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the chiefs were armed and at the trench before the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses got there, but these came up presently.</p>

    <p class=r>the son of saturn</p>
    <p class=l>as with the light the warriors’ toils begun.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sent a portent of evil sound about their host, and the dew fell</p>
    <p class=l>even jove, whose thunder spoke his wrath, distill’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>red with blood, for he was about to send many a brave man</p>
    <p class=l>red drops of blood o’er all the fatal field;[220]<br />the woes of men unwilling to survey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hurrying down to hades.</p>
    <p class=l>and all the slaughters that must stain the day.</p>

    <p class=r>the trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the</p>
    <p class=l>near ilus’ tomb, in order ranged around,<br />the trojan lines possess’d the rising ground:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>plain, were gathered round great hector, noble polydamas, aeneas</p>
    <p class=l>there wise polydamas and hector stood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who was honoured by the trojans like an immortal, and the three</p>
    <p class=l>æneas, honour’d as a guardian god;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>god.</p>
    <p class=l>and fair proportion match’d the ethereal race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector’s round shield showed in the front rank, and as some</p>
    <p class=l>great hector, cover’d with his spacious shield,<br />plies all the troops, and orders all the field.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>baneful star that shines for a moment through a rent in the</p>
    <p class=l>as the red star now shows his sanguine fires</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>clouds and is again hidden beneath them; even so was hector now</p>
    <p class=l>through the dark clouds, and now in night retires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seen in the front ranks and now again in the hindermost, and his</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bronze armour gleamed like the lightning of aegis-bearing jove.</p>
    <p class=l>flash from his arms, as lightning from the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon<br />a rich man’s land, and the sheaves fall thick before them, even</p>
    <p class=l>as sweating reapers in some wealthy field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so did the trojans and achaeans fall upon one another; they were</p>
    <p class=l>ranged in two bands, their crooked weapons wield,<br />bear down the furrows, till their labours meet;<br />thick fall the heapy harvests at their feet:<br />so greece and troy the field of war divide,<br />and falling ranks are strow’d on every side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in no mood for yielding but fought like wolves, and neither side</p>
    <p class=l>none stoop’d a thought to base inglorious flight;[221]<br />but horse to horse, and man to man they fight,<br />not rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>got the better of the other.</p>
    <p class=l>each wounds, each bleeds, but none resign the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>discord was glad as she beheld them,</p>
    <p class=l>discord with joy the scene of death descries,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for she was the only god that went among them; the others were</p>
    <p class=l>and drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not there, but stayed quietly each in his own home among the</p>
    <p class=l>discord alone, of all the immortal train,<br />swells the red horrors of this direful plain:<br />the gods in peace their golden mansions fill,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dells and valleys of olympus.</p>
    <p class=l>ranged in bright order on the olympian hill:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all of them blamed the son of<br />saturn for wanting to give victory to the trojans, but father</p>
    <p class=l>but general murmurs told their griefs above,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove heeded them not: he held aloof from all, and sat apart in</p>
    <p class=l>and each accused the partial will of jove.<br />meanwhile apart, superior, and alone,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his all-glorious majesty, looking down upon the city of the</p>
    <p class=l>the eternal monarch, on his awful throne,<br />wrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate;<br />and fix’d, fulfill’d the just decrees of fate.<br />on earth he turn’d his all-considering eyes,<br />and mark’d the spot where ilion’s towers arise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans, the ships of the achaeans, the gleam of bronze, and</p>
    <p class=l>the sea with ships, the fields with armies spread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alike upon the slayers and on the slain.</p>
    <p class=l>the victor’s rage, the dying, and the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, their</p>
    <p class=l>thus while the morning-beams, increasing bright,<br />o’er heaven’s pure azure spread the glowing light,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>darts rained thick on one another and the people perished, but as</p>
    <p class=l>commutual death the fate of war confounds,<br />each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the hour drew nigh when a woodman working in some mountain forest</p>
    <p class=l>but now (what time in some sequester’d vale</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will get his midday meal—for he has felled till his hands are<br />weary; he is tired out, and must now have food—then the danaans</p>
    <p class=l>the weary woodman spreads his sparing meal,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with a cry that rang through all their ranks, broke the</p>
    <p class=l>when his tired arms refuse the axe to rear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battalions of the enemy.</p>
    <p class=l>and claim a respite from the sylvan war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon led them on, and slew first</p>
    <p class=l>but not till half the prostrate forests lay<br />stretch’d in long ruin, and exposed to day)<br />then, nor till then, the greeks’ impulsive might<br />pierced the black phalanx, and let in the light.<br />great agamemnon then the slaughter led,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bienor, a leader of his people, and afterwards his comrade and</p>
    <p class=l>and slew bienor at his people’s head:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>charioteer oileus, who sprang from his chariot and was coming</p>
    <p class=l>whose squire oïleus, with a sudden spring,<br />leap’d from the chariot to revenge his king;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>full towards him; but agamemnon struck him on the forehead with<br />his spear; his bronze visor was of no avail against the weapon,</p>
    <p class=l>but in his front he felt the fatal wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which pierced both bronze and bone, so that his brains were<br />battered in and he was killed in full fight.</p>
    <p class=l>which pierced his brain, and stretch’d him on the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon stripped their shirts from off them and left them with</p>
    <p class=l>atrides spoil’d, and left them on the plain:<br />vain was their youth, their glittering armour vain:<br />now soil’d with dust, and naked to the sky,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their breasts all bare to lie where they had fallen.</p>
    <p class=l>their snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then went</p>
    <p class=l>two sons of priam next to battle move,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on to kill isus and antiphus two sons of priam, the one a</p>
    <p class=l>the product, one of marriage, one of love:[222]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bastard, the other born in wedlock; they were in the same</p>
    <p class=l>in the same car the brother-warriors ride;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariot—the bastard driving, while noble antiphus fought beside</p>
    <p class=l>this took the charge to combat, that to guide:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him.</p>
    <p class=l>far other task, than when they wont to keep,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles had once taken both of them prisoners in the glades</p>
    <p class=l>on ida’s tops, their father’s fleecy sheep.<br />these on the mountains once achilles found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of ida, and had bound them with fresh withes as they were</p>
    <p class=l>and captive led, with pliant osiers bound;<br />then to their sire for ample sums restored;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shepherding, but he had taken a ransom for them; now, however,</p>
    <p class=l>but now to perish by atrides’ sword:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon son of atreus smote isus in the chest above the nipple</p>
    <p class=l>pierced in the breast the base-born isus bleeds:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with his spear, while he struck antiphus hard by the ear and</p>
    <p class=l>cleft through the head his brother’s fate succeeds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>threw him from his chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>swift to the spoil the hasty victor falls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forthwith he stripped their goodly</p>
    <p class=l>and, stript, their features to his mind recalls.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>armour from off them and recognized them, for he had already seen</p>
    <p class=l>the trojans see the youths untimely die,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them at ships when achilles brought them in from ida.</p>
    <p class=l>but helpless tremble for themselves, and fly.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as a lion</p>
    <p class=l>so when a lion ranging o’er the lawns,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fastens on the fawns of a hind and crushes them in his great</p>
    <p class=l>finds, on some grassy lair, the couching fawns,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jaws, robbing them of their tender life while he on his way back</p>
    <p class=l>their bones he cracks, their reeking vitals draws,<br />and grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to his lair—the hind can do nothing for them even though she be<br />close by, for she is in an agony of fear, and flies through the</p>
    <p class=l>the frighted hind beholds, and dares not stay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thick forest, sweating, and at her utmost speed before the mighty</p>
    <p class=l>but swift through rustling thickets bursts her way;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>monster—so, no man of the trojans could help isus and antiphus,</p>
    <p class=l>all drown’d in sweat, the panting mother flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for they were themselves flying in panic before the argives.</p>
    <p class=l>and the big tears roll trickling from her eyes.<br />amidst the tumult of the routed train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then king agamemnon took the two sons of antimachus, pisander and<br />brave hippolochus.</p>
    <p class=l>the sons of false antimachus were slain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it was antimachus who had been foremost in</p>
    <p class=l>he who for bribes his faithless counsels sold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>preventing helen’s being restored to menelaus, for he was largely</p>
    <p class=l>and voted helen’s stay for paris’ gold.<br />atrides mark’d, as these their safety sought,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bribed by alexandrus; and now agamemnon took his two sons, both</p>
    <p class=l>and slew the children for the father’s fault;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the same chariot, trying to bring their horses to a stand—for<br />they had lost hold of the reins and the horses were mad with</p>
    <p class=l>their headstrong horse unable to restrain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fear.<br />the son of atreus sprang upon them like a lion, and the</p>
    <p class=l>they shook with fear, and dropp’d the silken rein;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pair besought him from their chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>then in the chariot on their knees they fall,<br />and thus with lifted hands for mercy call:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“take us alive,” they</p>
    <p class=l>“o spare our youth, and for the life we owe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cried, “son of atreus, and you shall receive a great ransom for</p>
    <p class=l>antimachus shall copious gifts bestow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>us.</p>
    <p class=l>soon as he hears, that, not in battle slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>our father antimachus has great store of gold, bronze, and</p>
    <p class=l>the grecian ships his captive sons detain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wrought iron, and from this he will satisfy you with a very large</p>
    <p class=l>large heaps of brass in ransom shall be told,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ransom should he hear of our being alive at the ships of the</p>
    <p class=l>and steel well-tempered, and persuasive gold.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, but</p>
    <p class=l>these words, attended with the flood of tears,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they heard no pitiful answer in return.</p>
    <p class=l>the youths address’d to unrelenting ears:<br />the vengeful monarch gave this stern reply:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“if,” said agamemnon,</p>
    <p class=l>“if from antimachus ye spring, ye die;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“you are sons of antimachus, who once at a council of trojans</p>
    <p class=l>the daring wretch who once in council stood</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>proposed that menelaus and ulysses, who had come to you as</p>
    <p class=l>to shed ulysses’ and my brother’s blood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>envoys, should be killed and not suffered to return, you shall</p>
    <p class=l>for proffer’d peace!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now pay for the foul iniquity of your father.</p>
    <p class=l>and sues his seed for grace?<br />no, die, and pay the forfeit of your race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he felled pisander from his chariot to the earth,</p>
    <p class=l>this said, pisander from the car he cast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>smiting him on the chest with his spear, so that he lay face</p>
    <p class=l>and pierced his breast: supine he breathed his last.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>uppermost upon the ground.<br />hippolochus fled, but him too did</p>
    <p class=l>his brother leap’d to earth; but, as he lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon smite; he cut off his hands and his head—which he sent</p>
    <p class=l>the trenchant falchion lopp’d his hands away;<br />his sever’d head was toss’d among the throng,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rolling in among the crowd as though it were a ball.<br />there he let</p>
    <p class=l>and, rolling, drew a bloody train along.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them both lie, and wherever the ranks were thickest thither he</p>
    <p class=l>then, where the thickest fought, the victor flew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flew, while the other achaeans followed.</p>
    <p class=l>the king’s example all his greeks pursue.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foot soldiers drove the<br />foot soldiers of the foe in rout before them, and slew them;</p>
    <p class=l>now by the foot the flying foot were slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horsemen did the like by horsemen, and the thundering tramp of</p>
    <p class=l>horse trod by horse, lay foaming on the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the horses raised a cloud of dust from off the plain.</p>
    <p class=l>from the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>king</p>
    <p class=l>shade the black host, and intercept the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon followed after, ever slaying them and cheering on the</p>
    <p class=l>the brass-hoof’d steeds tumultuous plunge and bound,<br />and the thick thunder beats the labouring ground,<br />still slaughtering on, the king of men proceeds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the distanced army wonders at his deeds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when some mighty forest is all ablaze—the eddying</p>
    <p class=l>as when the winds with raging flames conspire,<br />and o’er the forests roll the flood of fire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gusts whirl fire in all directions till the thickets shrivel and</p>
    <p class=l>in blazing heaps the grove’s old honours fall,<br />and one refulgent ruin levels all:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are consumed before the blast of the flame—even so fell the heads</p>
    <p class=l>before atrides’ rage so sinks the foe,<br />whole squadrons vanish, and proud heads lie low.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the flying trojans before agamemnon son of atreus, and many a</p>
    <p class=l>the steeds fly trembling from his waving sword,<br />and many a car, now lighted of its lord,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>noble pair of steeds drew an empty chariot along the highways of</p>
    <p class=l>wide o’er the field with guideless fury rolls,<br />breaking their ranks, and crushing out their souls;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>war, for lack of drivers who were lying on the plain, more useful</p>
    <p class=l>while his keen falchion drinks the warriors’ lives;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now to vultures than to their wives.</p>
    <p class=l>more grateful, now, to vultures than their wives!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove drew hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnage</p>
    <p class=l>perhaps great hector then had found his fate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and din of battle; but the son of atreus sped onwards, calling</p>
    <p class=l>but jove and destiny prolong’d his date.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>out lustily to the danaans.</p>
    <p class=l>safe from the darts, the care of heaven he stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they flew on by the tomb of old ilus,</p>
    <p class=l>amidst alarms, and death, and dust, and blood.<br />now past the tomb where ancient ilus lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of dardanus, in the middle of the plain, and past the place</p>
    <p class=l>through the mid field the routed urge their way:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the wild fig-tree making always for the city—the son of atreus</p>
    <p class=l>where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown,<br />the path they take, and speed to reach the town.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>still shouting, and with hands all bedrabbled in gore; but when</p>
    <p class=l>as swift, atrides with loud shouts pursued,<br />hot with his toil, and bathed in hostile blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they had reached the scaean gates and the oak tree, there they</p>
    <p class=l>now near the beech-tree, and the scæan gates,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>halted and waited for the others to come up.</p>
    <p class=l>the hero halts, and his associates waits.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile on every side around the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans kept on flying over the middle of the plain like a herd</p>
    <p class=l>dispersed, disorder’d, fly the trojan train.<br />so flies a herd of beeves, that hear dismay’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them in the</p>
    <p class=l>the lion’s roaring through the midnight shade;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dead of night—he springs on one of them, seizes her neck in the</p>
    <p class=l>on heaps they tumble with successless haste;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grip of his strong teeth and then laps up her blood and gorges</p>
    <p class=l>the savage seizes, draws, and rends the last.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>himself upon her entrails—even so did king agamemnon son of</p>
    <p class=l>not with less fury stern atrides flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus pursue the foe, ever slaughtering the hindmost as they<br />fled pell-mell before him.</p>
    <p class=l>still press’d the rout, and still the hindmost slew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many a man was flung headlong from his<br />chariot by the hand of the son of atreus, for he wielded his</p>
    <p class=l>hurl’d from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear with fury.</p>
    <p class=l>and rage, and death, and carnage load the field.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city,</p>
    <p class=l>now storms the victor at the trojan wall;<br />surveys the towers, and meditates their fall.<br />but jove descending shook the idaean hills,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the father of gods and men came down from heaven and took his</p>
    <p class=l>and down their summits pour’d a hundred rills:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seat, thunderbolt in hand, upon the crest of many-fountained ida.</p>
    <p class=l>the unkindled lightning in his hand he took,<br />and thus the many-coloured maid bespoke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then told iris of the golden wings to carry a message for him.</p>
    <p class=l>“iris, with haste thy golden wings display,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“go,” said he, “fleet iris, and speak thus to hector—say that so</p>
    <p class=l>to godlike hector this our word convey—</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>long as he sees agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the</p>
    <p class=l>while agamemnon wastes the ranks around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojan ranks, he is to keep aloof and bid the others bear the</p>
    <p class=l>fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,<br />bid him give way; but issue forth commands,<br />and trust the war to less important hands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brunt of the battle, but when agamemnon is wounded either by</p>
    <p class=l>but when, or wounded by the spear or dart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear or arrow, and takes to his chariot, then will i vouchsafe</p>
    <p class=l>that chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,<br />then jove shall string his arm, and fire his breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him strength to slay till he reach the ships and night falls at</p>
    <p class=l>then to her ships shall flying greece be press’d,</p>

    <p class=r>the going down of the sun.</p>
    <p class=l>till to the main the burning sun descend,<br />and sacred night her awful shade extend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>iris hearkened and obeyed.</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, and iris at his word obey’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>down she went to strong ilius from the</p>
    <p class=l>on wings of winds descends the various maid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>crests of ida, and found hector son of priam standing by his</p>
    <p class=l>the chief she found amidst the ranks of war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariot and horses.</p>
    <p class=l>close to the bulwarks, on his glittering car.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then she said, “hector son of priam, peer of</p>
    <p class=l>the goddess then: “o son of priam, hear!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>message—so long as you see agamemnon heading his men and making</p>
    <p class=l>while agamemnon wastes the ranks around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>havoc of the trojan ranks, you are to keep aloof and bid the</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when she had thus spoken iris left him, and hector sprang full</p>
    <p class=l>she said, and vanish’d.<br />hector, with a bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>armed from his chariot to the ground, brandishing his spear as he</p>
    <p class=l>springs from his chariot on the trembling ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went about everywhere among the host, cheering his men on to</p>
    <p class=l>in clanging arms: he grasps in either hand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight, and stirring the dread strife of battle.</p>
    <p class=l>a pointed lance, and speeds from band to band;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans then</p>
    <p class=l>revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wheeled round, and again met the achaeans, while the argives on</p>
    <p class=l>and wakes anew the dying flames of fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their part strengthened their battalions.</p>
    <p class=l>they stand to arms: the greeks their onset dare,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the battle was now in</p>
    <p class=l>condense their powers, and wait the coming war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>array and they stood face to face with one another, agamemnon</p>
    <p class=l>new force, new spirit, to each breast returns;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ever pressing forward in his eagerness to be ahead of all others.</p>
    <p class=l>the fight renew’d with fiercer fury burns:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tell me now ye muses that dwell in the mansions of olympus, who,</p>
    <p class=l>the king leads on: all fix on him their eye,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whether of the trojans or of their allies, was first to face</p>
    <p class=l>and learn from him to conquer, or to die.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon?</p>
    <p class=l>ye sacred nine!<br />celestial muses!<br />tell,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it was iphidamas son of antenor, a man both brave and</p>
    <p class=l>who faced him first, and by his prowess fell?<br />the great iphidamas, the bold and young,<br />from sage antenor and theano sprung;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of great stature, who was brought up in fertile thrace, the</p>
    <p class=l>whom from his youth his grandsire cisseus bred,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mother of sheep.</p>
    <p class=l>and nursed in thrace where snowy flocks are fed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cisses, his mother’s father, brought him up in</p>
    <p class=l>scarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest,<br />and early honour warm his generous breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his own house when he was a child—cisses, father to fair theano.</p>
    <p class=l>when the kind sire consign’d his daughter’s charms<br />(theano’s sister) to his youthful arms.<br />but call’d by glory to the wars of troy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he reached manhood, cisses would have kept him there, and</p>
    <p class=l>he leaves untasted the first fruits of joy;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was for giving him his daughter in marriage, but as soon as he</p>
    <p class=l>from his loved bride departs with melting eyes,<br />and swift to aid his dearer country flies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had married he set out to fight the achaeans with twelve ships<br />that followed him: these he had left at percote and had come on</p>
    <p class=l>with twelve black ships he reach’d percope’s strand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by land to ilius.</p>
    <p class=l>thence took the long laborious march by land.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he it was that now met agamemnon son of atreus.</p>
    <p class=l>now fierce for fame, before the ranks he springs,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they were close up with one another, the son of atreus</p>
    <p class=l>towering in arms, and braves the king of kings.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>missed his aim, and iphidamas hit him on the girdle below the</p>
    <p class=l>atrides first discharged the missive spear;<br />the trojan stoop’d, the javelin pass’d in air.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cuirass and then flung himself upon him, trusting to his strength</p>
    <p class=l>then near the corslet, at the monarch’s heart,<br />with all his strength, the youth directs his dart:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of arm; the girdle, however, was not pierced, nor nearly so, for</p>
    <p class=l>but the broad belt, with plates of silver bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the point of the spear struck against the silver and was turned</p>
    <p class=l>the point rebated, and repell’d the wound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aside as though it had been lead: king agamemnon caught it from</p>
    <p class=l>encumber’d with the dart, atrides stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his hand, and drew it towards him with the fury of a lion; he</p>
    <p class=l>till, grasp’d with force, he wrench’d it from his hands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then drew his sword, and killed iphidamas by striking him on the</p>
    <p class=l>at once his weighty sword discharged a wound</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neck.</p>
    <p class=l>full on his neck, that fell’d him to the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so there the poor fellow lay, sleeping a sleep as it were</p>
    <p class=l>stretch’d in the dust the unhappy warrior lies,<br />and sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes.<br />oh worthy better fate!<br />oh early slain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of bronze, killed in the defence of his fellow-citizens, far from</p>
    <p class=l>thy country’s friend; and virtuous, though in vain!<br />no more the youth shall join his consort’s side,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his wedded wife, of whom he had had no joy though he had given</p>
    <p class=l>at once a virgin, and at once a bride!<br />no more with presents her embraces meet,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>much for her: he had given a hundred head of cattle down, and had</p>
    <p class=l>or lay the spoils of conquest at her feet,<br />on whom his passion, lavish of his store,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>promised later on to give a thousand sheep and goats mixed, from</p>
    <p class=l>bestow’d so much, and vainly promised more!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the countless flocks of which he was possessed.<br />agamemnon son of</p>
    <p class=l>unwept, uncover’d, on the plain he lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus then despoiled him, and carried off his armour into the</p>
    <p class=l>while the proud victor bore his arms away.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>host of the achaeans.<br />when noble coon, antenor’s eldest son, saw this, sore indeed were</p>
    <p class=l>coon, antenor’s eldest hope, was nigh:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his eyes at the sight of his fallen brother.</p>
    <p class=l>tears, at the sight, came starting from his eye,<br />while pierced with grief the much-loved youth he view’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>unseen by agamemnon</p>
    <p class=l>and the pale features now deform’d with blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he got beside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in the middle</p>
    <p class=l>then, with his spear, unseen, his time he took,<br />aim’d at the king, and near his elbow strook.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of his arm below the elbow, the point of the spear going right</p>
    <p class=l>the thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through the arm.</p>
    <p class=l>and through his arm stood forth the barbed dart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon was convulsed with pain, but still not</p>
    <p class=l>surprised the monarch feels, yet void of fear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even for this did he leave off struggling and fighting, but<br />grasped his spear that flew as fleet as the wind, and sprang upon</p>
    <p class=l>on coon rushes with his lifted spear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>coon who was trying to drag off the body of his brother—his</p>
    <p class=l>his brother’s corpse the pious trojan draws,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father’s son—by the foot, and was crying for help to all the</p>
    <p class=l>and calls his country to assert his cause;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bravest of his comrades; but agamemnon struck him with a</p>
    <p class=l>defends him breathless on the sanguine field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bronze-shod spear and killed him as he was dragging the dead body</p>
    <p class=l>and o’er the body spreads his ample shield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through the press of men under cover of his shield: he then cut</p>
    <p class=l>atrides, marking an unguarded part,<br />transfix’d the warrior with his brazen dart;<br />prone on his brother’s bleeding breast he lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>off his head, standing over the body of iphidamas.</p>
    <p class=l>the monarch’s falchion lopp’d his head away:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did the<br />sons of antenor meet their fate at the hands of the son of</p>
    <p class=l>the social shades the same dark journey go,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus, and go down into the house of hades.</p>
    <p class=l>and join each other in the realms below.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as long as the blood still welled warm from his wound agamemnon</p>
    <p class=l>the vengeful victor rages round the fields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went about attacking the ranks of the enemy with spear and sword</p>
    <p class=l>with every weapon art or fury yields:<br />by the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,<br />whole ranks are broken, and whole troops o’erthrown.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and with great handfuls of stone, but when the blood had ceased</p>
    <p class=l>this, while yet warm distill’d the purple flood;<br />but when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to flow and the wound grew dry, the pain became great.</p>
    <p class=l>then grinding tortures his strong bosom rend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as the</p>
    <p class=l>less keen those darts the fierce ilythiae send:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sharp pangs which the eilithuiae, goddesses of childbirth,</p>
    <p class=l>(the powers that cause the teeming matron’s throes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>daughters of juno and dispensers of cruel pain, send upon a woman<br />when she is in labour—even so sharp were the pangs of the son of</p>
    <p class=l>sad mothers of unutterable woes!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus.</p>
    <p class=l>)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he sprang on to his chariot, and bade his charioteer</p>
    <p class=l>stung with the smart, all-panting with the pain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drive to the ships, for he was in great agony.</p>
    <p class=l>he mounts the car, and gives his squire the rein;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with a loud clear</p>
    <p class=l>then with a voice which fury made more strong,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>voice he shouted to the danaans, “my friends, princes and</p>
    <p class=l>and pain augmented, thus exhorts the throng:<br />“o friends!<br />o greeks!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>counsellors of the argives, defend the ships yourselves, for jove</p>
    <p class=l>assert your honours won;<br />proceed, and finish what this arm begun:<br />lo!<br />angry jove forbids your chief to stay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>has not suffered me to fight the whole day through against the</p>
    <p class=l>and envies half the glories of the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, and</p>
    <p class=l>he said: the driver whirls his lengthful thong;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they flew forward nothing loth.</p>
    <p class=l>the horses fly; the chariot smokes along.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their chests were white with foam</p>
    <p class=l>clouds from their nostrils the fierce coursers blow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and their bellies with dust, as they drew the wounded king out of</p>
    <p class=l>and from their sides the foam descends in snow;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the battle.</p>
    <p class=l>shot through the battle in a moment’s space,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when hector saw agamemnon quit the field, he shouted to the</p>
    <p class=l>the wounded monarch at his tent they place.<br />no sooner hector saw the king retired,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans and lycians saying, “trojans, lycians, and dardanian</p>
    <p class=l>but thus his trojans and his aids he fired:<br />“hear, all ye dardan, all ye lycian race!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>warriors, be men, my friends, and acquit yourselves in battle</p>
    <p class=l>famed in close fight, and dreadful face to face:<br />now call to mind your ancient trophies won,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bravely; their best man has left them, and jove has vouchsafed me</p>
    <p class=l>your great forefathers’ virtues, and your own.<br />behold, the general flies!<br />deserts his powers!<br />lo, jove himself declares the conquest ours!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a great triumph; charge the foe with your chariots that you may</p>
    <p class=l>now on yon ranks impel your foaming steeds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>win still greater glory.</p>
    <p class=l>and, sure of glory, dare immortal deeds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he put heart and soul into them all, and as a</p>
    <p class=l>with words like these the fiery chief alarms<br />his fainting host, and every bosom warms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>huntsman hounds his dogs on against a lion or wild boar, even so</p>
    <p class=l>as the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear<br />the brindled lion, or the tusky bear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did hector, peer of mars, hound the proud trojans on against the</p>
    <p class=l>with voice and hand provokes their doubting heart,<br />and springs the foremost with his lifted dart:<br />so godlike hector prompts his troops to dare;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>nor prompts alone, but leads himself the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>full of hope he plunged in among the foremost, and fell</p>
    <p class=l>on the black body of the foe he pours;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on the fight like some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the</p>
    <p class=l>as from the cloud’s deep bosom, swell’d with showers,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sea, and lashes its deep blue waters into fury.</p>
    <p class=l>a sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps,<br />drives the wild waves, and tosses all the deeps.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what, then is the full tale of those whom hector son of priam</p>
    <p class=l>say, muse!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>killed in the hour of triumph which jove then vouchsafed him?</p>
    <p class=l>when jove the trojan’s glory crown’d,<br />beneath his arm what heroes bit the ground?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first asaeus, autonous, and opites; dolops son of clytius,<br />opheltius and agelaus; aesymnus, orus and hipponous steadfast in</p>
    <p class=l>assaeus, dolops, and autonous died,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battle; these chieftains of the achaeans did hector slay, and</p>
    <p class=l>opites next was added to their side;<br />then brave hipponous, famed in many a fight,<br />opheltius, orus, sunk to endless night;<br />æsymnus, agelaus; all chiefs of name;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he fell upon the rank and file.</p>
    <p class=l>the rest were vulgar deaths unknown to fame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when the west wind</p>
    <p class=l>as when a western whirlwind, charged with storms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hustles the clouds of the white south and beats them down with</p>
    <p class=l>dispels the gather’d clouds that notus forms:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fierceness of its fury—the waves of the sea roll high, and</p>
    <p class=l>the gust continued, violent and strong,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the spray is flung aloft in the rage of the wandering wind—even</p>
    <p class=l>rolls sable clouds in heaps on heaps along;<br />now to the skies the foaming billows rears,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so thick were the heads of them that fell by the hand of hector.</p>
    <p class=l>now breaks the surge, and wide the bottom bares:<br />thus, raging hector, with resistless hands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all had then been lost and no help for it, and the achaeans would</p>
    <p class=l>o’erturns, confounds, and scatters all their bands.<br />now the last ruin the whole host appals;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have fled pell-mell to their ships, had not ulysses cried out to</p>
    <p class=l>now greece had trembled in her wooden walls;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed, “son of tydeus, what has happened to us that we thus</p>
    <p class=l>but wise ulysses call’d tydides forth,<br />his soul rekindled, and awaked his worth.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forget our prowess?<br />come, my good fellow, stand by my side and</p>
    <p class=l>“and stand we deedless, o eternal shame!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>help me, we shall be shamed for ever if hector takes the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>till hector’s arm involve the ships in flame?<br />haste, let us join, and combat side by side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and diomed answered, “come what may, i will stand firm; but we</p>
    <p class=l>the warrior thus, and thus the friend replied:<br />“no martial toil i shun, no danger fear;<br />let hector come; i wait his fury here.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall have scant joy of it, for jove is minded to give victory to</p>
    <p class=l>but jove with conquest crowns the trojan train:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans rather than to us.</p>
    <p class=l>and, jove our foe, all human force is vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he struck thymbraeus from his chariot to the</p>
    <p class=l>he sigh’d; but, sighing, raised his vengeful steel,<br />and from his car the proud thymbraeus fell:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ground, smiting him in the left breast with his spear, while</p>
    <p class=l>molion, the charioteer, pursued his lord,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses killed molion who was his squire.</p>
    <p class=l>his death ennobled by ulysses’ sword.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these they let lie, now</p>
    <p class=l>there slain, they left them in eternal night,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that they had stopped their fighting; the two heroes then went on</p>
    <p class=l>then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>playing havoc with the foe, like two wild boars that turn in fury<br />and rend the hounds that hunt them.</p>
    <p class=l>so two wild boars outstrip the following hounds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did they turn upon the</p>
    <p class=l>then swift revert, and wounds return for wounds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans and slay them, and the achaeans were thankful to have</p>
    <p class=l>stern hector’s conquests in the middle plain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>breathing time in their flight from hector.</p>
    <p class=l>stood check’d awhile, and greece respired again.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons of</p>
    <p class=l>the sons of merops shone amidst the war;<br />towering they rode in one refulgent car:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>merops of percote, who excelled all others in the arts of<br />divination.</p>
    <p class=l>in deep prophetic arts their father skill’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he had forbidden his sons to go to the war, but they</p>
    <p class=l>had warn’d his children from the trojan field.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would not obey him, for fate lured them to their fall.</p>
    <p class=l>fate urged them on: the father warn’d in vain;<br />they rush’d to fight, and perish’d on the plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed son</p>
    <p class=l>their breasts no more the vital spirit warms;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of tydeus slew them both and stripped them of their armour, while</p>
    <p class=l>the stern tydides strips their shining arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses killed hippodamus and hypeirochus.</p>
    <p class=l>hypirochus by great ulysses dies,<br />and rich hippodamus becomes his prize.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now the son of saturn as he looked down from ida ordained</p>
    <p class=l>great jove from ide with slaughter fills his sight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that neither side should have the advantage, and they kept on<br />killing one another.</p>
    <p class=l>and level hangs the doubtful scale of fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of tydeus speared agastrophus son of</p>
    <p class=l>by tydeus’ lance agastrophus was slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>paeon in the hip-joint with his spear.</p>
    <p class=l>the far-famed hero of pæonian strain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his chariot was not at<br />hand for him to fly with, so blindly confident had he been.</p>
    <p class=l>wing’d with his fears, on foot he strove to fly,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his</p>
    <p class=l>his steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>squire was in charge of it at some distance and he was fighting</p>
    <p class=l>through broken orders, swifter than the wind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on foot among the foremost until he lost his life.</p>
    <p class=l>he fled, but flying left his life behind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector soon</p>
    <p class=l>this hector sees, as his experienced eyes</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>marked the havoc diomed and ulysses were making, and bore down</p>
    <p class=l>traverse the files, and to the rescue flies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon them with a loud cry, followed by the trojan ranks; brave</p>
    <p class=l>shouts, as he pass’d, the crystal regions rend,<br />and moving armies on his march attend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed was dismayed when he saw them, and said to ulysses who was</p>
    <p class=l>great diomed himself was seized with fear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beside him, “great hector is bearing down upon us and we shall be</p>
    <p class=l>and thus bespoke his brother of the war:<br />“mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset.</p>
    <p class=l>the storm rolls on, and hector rules the field:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>here stand his utmost force.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, nor did he miss<br />his mark.</p>
    <p class=l>”—the warrior said;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he had aimed at hector’s head near the top of his</p>
    <p class=l>swift at the word his ponderous javelin fled;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>helmet, but bronze was turned by bronze, and hector was</p>
    <p class=l>nor miss’d its aim, but where the plumage danced</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>untouched, for the spear was stayed by the visored helm made with</p>
    <p class=l>razed the smooth cone, and thence obliquely glanced.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>three plates of metal, which phoebus apollo had given him.</p>
    <p class=l>safe in his helm (the gift of phœbus’ hands)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector</p>
    <p class=l>without a wound the trojan hero stands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sprang back with a great bound under cover of the ranks; he fell</p>
    <p class=l>but yet so stunn’d, that, staggering on the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on his knees and propped himself with his brawny hand leaning on</p>
    <p class=l>his arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ground, for darkness had fallen on his eyes.</p>
    <p class=l>o’er his dim sight the misty vapours rise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of</p>
    <p class=l>and a short darkness shades his swimming eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tydeus having thrown his spear dashed in among the foremost<br />fighters, to the place where he had seen it strike the ground;</p>
    <p class=l>tydides followed to regain his lance;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile hector recovered himself and springing back into his</p>
    <p class=l>while hector rose, recover’d from the trance,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariot mingled with the crowd, by which means he saved his life.</p>
    <p class=l>remounts his car, and herds amidst the crowd:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but diomed made at him with his spear and said, “dog, you have</p>
    <p class=l>the greek pursues him, and exults aloud:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>again got away though death was close on your heels.</p>
    <p class=l>“once more thank phœbus for thy forfeit breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>phoebus</p>
    <p class=l>or thank that swiftness which outstrips the death.</p>

    <p class=r>apollo, to whom i ween you pray ere you go into battle, has again</p>
    <p class=l>well by apollo are thy prayers repaid,<br />and oft that partial power has lent his aid.</p>

    <p class=r>saved you, nevertheless i will meet you and make an end of you</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hereafter, if there is any god who will stand by me too and be my</p>
    <p class=l>if any god assist tydides’ hand.</p>

    <p class=r>helper.</p>
    <p class=l>fly then, inglorious!</p>

    <p class=r>as he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of paeon,</p>
    <p class=l>him, while he triumph’d, paris eyed from far,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but alexandrus husband of lovely helen aimed an arrow at him,</p>
    <p class=l>(the spouse of helen, the fair cause of war;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>leaning against a pillar of the monument which men had raised to</p>
    <p class=l>around the fields his feather’d shafts he sent,<br />from ancient ilus’ ruin’d monument:<br />behind the column placed, he bent his bow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ilus son of dardanus, a ruler in days of old.</p>
    <p class=l>and wing’d an arrow at the unwary foe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed had taken</p>
    <p class=l>just as he stoop’d, agastrophus’s crest</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the cuirass from off the breast of agastrophus, his heavy helmet<br />also, and the shield from off his shoulders, when paris drew his</p>
    <p class=l>to seize, and drew the corslet from his breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bow and let fly an arrow that sped not from his hand in vain, but</p>
    <p class=l>the bowstring twang’d; nor flew the shaft in vain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pierced the flat of diomed’s right foot, going right through it<br />and fixing itself in the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>but pierced his foot, and nail’d it to the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon paris with a hearty</p>
    <p class=l>the laughing trojan, with a joyful spring.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>laugh sprang forward from his hiding-place, and taunted him</p>
    <p class=l>leaps from his ambush, and insults the king.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saying, “you are wounded—my arrow has not been shot in vain;</p>
    <p class=l>“he bleeds!<br />(he cries) some god has sped my dart!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would that it had hit you in the belly and killed you, for thus</p>
    <p class=l>would the same god had fix’d it in his heart!<br />so troy, relieved from that wide-wasting hand,<br />should breathe from slaughter and in combat stand:<br />whose sons now tremble at his darted spear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans, who fear you as goats fear a lion, would have had a</p>
    <p class=l>as scatter’d lambs the rushing lion fear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>truce from evil.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed all undaunted answered, “archer, you who without your bow</p>
    <p class=l>he dauntless thus: “thou conqueror of the fair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are nothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in</p>
    <p class=l>thou woman-warrior with the curling hair;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>single combat fighting in full armour, your bow and your arrows<br />would serve you in little stead.</p>
    <p class=l>vain archer!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vain is your boast in that you</p>
    <p class=l>trusting to the distant dart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have scratched the sole of my foot.</p>
    <p class=l>unskill’d in arms to act a manly part!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i care no more than if a girl<br />or some silly boy had hit me.</p>
    <p class=l>thou hast but done what boys or women can;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a worthless coward can inflict but</p>
    <p class=l>such hands may wound, but not incense a man.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a light wound; when i wound a man though i but graze his skin it</p>
    <p class=l>nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is another matter, for my weapon will lay him low.</p>
    <p class=l>a coward’s weapon never hurts the brave.</p>

    <p class=r>his wife will</p>
    <p class=l>not so this dart, which thou may’st one day feel;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tear her cheeks for grief and his children will be fatherless:</p>
    <p class=l>fate wings its flight, and death is on the steel:<br />where this but lights, some noble life expires;<br />its touch makes orphans, bathes the cheeks of sires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there will he rot, reddening the earth with his blood, and</p>
    <p class=l>steeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vultures, not women, will gather round him.</p>
    <p class=l>and leaves such objects as distract the fair.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus he spoke, but ulysses came up and stood over him.</p>
    <p class=l>ulysses hastens with a trembling heart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>under this<br />cover he sat down to draw the arrow from his foot, and sharp was<br />the pain he suffered as he did so.<br />then he sprang on to his</p>
    <p class=l>before him steps, and bending draws the dart:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariot and bade the charioteer drive him to the ships, for he</p>
    <p class=l>forth flows the blood; an eager pang succeeds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was sick at heart.</p>
    <p class=l>tydides mounts, and to the navy speeds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses was now alone; not one of the argives stood by him, for</p>
    <p class=l>now on the field ulysses stands alone,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were all panic-stricken.</p>
    <p class=l>the greeks all fled, the trojans pouring on;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“alas,” said he to himself in his</p>
    <p class=l>but stands collected in himself, and whole,<br />and questions thus his own unconquer’d soul:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dismay, “what will become of me?</p>
    <p class=l>“what further subterfuge, what hopes remain?<br />what shame, inglorious if i quit the plain?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it is ill if i turn and fly<br />before these odds, but it will be worse if i am left alone and</p>
    <p class=l>what danger, singly if i stand the ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>taken prisoner, for the son of saturn has struck the rest of the</p>
    <p class=l>my friends all scatter’d, all the foes around?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>danaans with panic.<br />but why talk to myself in this way?</p>
    <p class=l>yet wherefore doubtful?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>well do i</p>
    <p class=l>let this truth suffice,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>know that though cowards quit the field, a hero, whether he wound</p>
    <p class=l>the brave meets danger, and the coward flies.<br />to die or conquer, proves a hero’s heart;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or be wounded, must stand firm and hold his own.</p>
    <p class=l>and, knowing this, i know a soldier’s part.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the trojans advanced</p>
    <p class=l>such thoughts revolving in his careful breast,<br />near, and more near, the shady cohorts press’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and hemmed him in, and bitterly did they come to rue it.</p>
    <p class=l>these, in the warrior, their own fate enclose;<br />and round him deep the steely circle grows.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as</p>
    <p class=l>so fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hounds and lusty youths set upon a wild boar that sallies from</p>
    <p class=l>of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his lair whetting his white tusks—they attack him from every side</p>
    <p class=l>he grinds his ivory tusks; he foams with ire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and can hear the gnashing of his jaws, but for all his fierceness</p>
    <p class=l>his sanguine eye-balls glare with living fire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they still hold their ground—even so furiously did the trojans</p>
    <p class=l>by these, by those, on every part is plied;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>attack ulysses.</p>
    <p class=l>and the red slaughter spreads on every side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first he sprang spear in hand upon deiopites and<br />wounded him on the shoulder with a downward blow; then he killed</p>
    <p class=l>pierced through the shoulder, first deiopis fell;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thoon and ennomus.<br />after these he struck chersidamas in the loins</p>
    <p class=l>next ennomus and thoon sank to hell;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>under his shield as he had just sprung down from his chariot; so</p>
    <p class=l>chersidamas, beneath the navel thrust,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he fell in the dust and clutched the earth in the hollow of his</p>
    <p class=l>falls prone to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hand.</p>
    <p class=l>charops, the son of hippasus, was near;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these he let lie, and went on to wound charops son of</p>
    <p class=l>ulysses reach’d him with the fatal spear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hippasus own brother to noble socus.</p>
    <p class=l>but to his aid his brother socus flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>socus, hero that he was,</p>
    <p class=l>socus the brave, the generous, and the wise.<br />near as he drew, the warrior thus began:<br />“o great ulysses!<br />much-enduring man!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>made all speed to help him, and when he was close to ulysses he</p>
    <p class=l>not deeper skill’d in every martial sleight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said, “far-famed ulysses, insatiable of craft and toil, this day</p>
    <p class=l>than worn to toils, and active in the fight!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you shall either boast of having killed both the sons of hippasus</p>
    <p class=l>this day two brothers shall thy conquest grace,<br />and end at once the great hippasian race,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and stripped them of their armour, or you shall fall before my</p>
    <p class=l>or thou beneath this lance must press the field.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he struck the shield of ulysses.</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and forceful pierced his spacious shield:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the spear went<br />through the shield and passed on through his richly wrought</p>
    <p class=l>through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cuirass, tearing the flesh from his side, but pallas minerva did</p>
    <p class=l>plough’d half his side, and bared it to the bone.<br />by pallas’ care, the spear, though deep infix’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not suffer it to pierce the entrails of the hero.</p>
    <p class=l>stopp’d short of life, nor with his entrails mix’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses knew</p>
    <p class=l>the wound not mortal wise ulysses knew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that his hour was not yet come, but he gave ground and said to</p>
    <p class=l>then furious thus (but first some steps withdrew):</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>socus, “wretch, you shall now surely die.</p>
    <p class=l>“unhappy man!<br />whose death our hands shall grace,<br />fate calls thee hence and finish’d is thy race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you have stayed me from</p>
    <p class=l>nor longer check my conquests on the foe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fighting further with the trojans, but you shall now fall by my</p>
    <p class=l>but, pierced by this, to endless darkness go,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear, yielding glory to myself, and your soul to hades of the</p>
    <p class=l>and add one spectre to the realms below!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>noble steeds.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>socus had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, while socus, seized with sudden fright,<br />trembling gave way, and turn’d his back to flight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him in the back midway between the shoulders, and went right</p>
    <p class=l>between his shoulders pierced the following dart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through his chest.</p>
    <p class=l>and held its passage through the panting heart:<br />wide in his breast appear’d the grisly wound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he fell heavily to the ground and ulysses</p>
    <p class=l>he falls; his armour rings against the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vaunted over him saying, “o socus, son of hippasus tamer of</p>
    <p class=l>then thus ulysses, gazing on the slain:<br />“famed son of hippasus!<br />there press the plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses, death has been too quick for you and you have not escaped</p>
    <p class=l>there ends thy narrow span assign’d by fate,<br />heaven owes ulysses yet a longer date.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him: poor wretch, not even in death shall your father and mother</p>
    <p class=l>ah, wretch!<br />no father shall thy corpse compose;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>close your eyes, but the ravening vultures shall enshroud you</p>
    <p class=l>thy dying eyes no tender mother close;<br />but hungry birds shall tear those balls away,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with the flapping of their dark wings and devour you.</p>
    <p class=l>and hovering vultures scream around their prey.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so saying he drew socus’s heavy spear out of his flesh and from</p>
    <p class=l>then raging with intolerable smart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his shield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was<br />withdrawn so that he was much dismayed.</p>
    <p class=l>he writhes his body, and extracts the dart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the trojans saw that</p>
    <p class=l>the dart a tide of spouting gore pursued,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses was bleeding they raised a great shout and came on in a</p>
    <p class=l>and gladden’d troy with sight of hostile blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body towards him; he therefore gave ground, and called his</p>
    <p class=l>now troops on troops the fainting chief invade,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>comrades to come and help him.</p>
    <p class=l>forced he recedes, and loudly calls for aid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thrice did he cry as loudly as man</p>
    <p class=l>thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can cry, and thrice did brave menelaus hear him; he turned,</p>
    <p class=l>the well-known voice thrice menelaus hears:<br />alarm’d, to ajax telamon he cried,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, to ajax who was close beside him and said, “ajax,</p>
    <p class=l>who shares his labours, and defends his side:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>noble son of telamon, captain of your people, the cry of ulysses</p>
    <p class=l>“o friend!</p>

    <p class=r>rings in my ears, as though the trojans had cut him off and were</p>
    <p class=l>ulysses’ shouts invade my ear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>worsting him while he is single-handed.</p>
    <p class=l>distressed he seems, and no assistance near;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us make our way</p>
    <p class=l>strong as he is, yet one opposed to all,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through the throng; it will be well that we defend him; i fear he</p>
    <p class=l>oppress’d by multitudes, the best may fall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may come to harm for all his valour if he be left without</p>
    <p class=l>greece robb’d of him must bid her host despair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>support, and the danaans would miss him sorely.</p>
    <p class=l>and feel a loss not ages can repair.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he led the way and mighty ajax went with him.</p>
    <p class=l>then, where the cry directs, his course he bends;<br />great ajax, like the god of war, attends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans had</p>
    <p class=l>the prudent chief in sore distress they found,<br />with bands of furious trojans compass’d round.<br />[223]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gathered round ulysses like ravenous mountain jackals round the</p>
    <p class=l>as when some huntsman, with a flying spear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>carcase of some horned stag that has been hit with an arrow—the</p>

    <p class=r>stag has fled at full speed so long as his blood was warm and his</p>
    <p class=l>down his cleft side, while fresh the blood distils,<br />he bounds aloft, and scuds from hills to hills,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strength has lasted, but when the arrow has overcome him, the</p>
    <p class=l>till life’s warm vapour issuing through the wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>savage jackals devour him in the shady glades of the forest.</p>
    <p class=l>wild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then</p>
    <p class=l>just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heaven sends a fierce lion thither, whereon the jackals fly in</p>
    <p class=l>the lion rushes through the woodland shade,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>terror and the lion robs them of their prey—even so did trojans<br />many and brave gather round crafty ulysses, but the hero stood at</p>
    <p class=l>the wolves, though hungry, scour dispersed away;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bay and kept them off with his spear.</p>
    <p class=l>the lordly savage vindicates his prey.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax then came up with his</p>
    <p class=l>ulysses thus, unconquer’d by his pains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shield before him like a wall, and stood hard by, whereon the</p>
    <p class=l>a single warrior half a host sustains:<br />but soon as ajax leaves his tower-like shield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans fled in all directions.</p>
    <p class=l>the scattered crowds fly frighted o’er the field;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus took ulysses by the</p>
    <p class=l>atrides’ arm the sinking hero stays,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hand, and led him out of the press while his squire brought up</p>
    <p class=l>and, saved from numbers, to his car conveys.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his chariot, but ajax rushed furiously on the trojans and killed</p>
    <p class=l>victorious ajax plies the routed crew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>doryclus, a bastard son of priam; then he wounded pandocus,</p>
    <p class=l>and first doryclus, priam’s son, he slew,<br />on strong pandocus next inflicts a wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lysandrus, pyrasus, and pylartes; as some swollen torrent comes</p>
    <p class=l>and lays lysander bleeding on the ground.<br />as when a torrent, swell’d with wintry rains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rushing in full flood from the mountains on to the plain, big</p>
    <p class=l>pours from the mountains o’er the deluged plains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with the rain of heaven—many a dry oak and many a pine does it</p>
    <p class=l>and pines and oaks, from their foundations torn,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>engulf, and much mud does it bring down and cast into the</p>
    <p class=l>a country’s ruins!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sea—even so did brave ajax chase the foe furiously over the</p>
    <p class=l>to the seas are borne:<br />fierce ajax thus o’erwhelms the yielding throng;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>plain, slaying both men and horses.</p>
    <p class=l>men, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector did not yet know what ajax was doing, for he was fighting</p>
    <p class=l>but hector, from this scene of slaughter far,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on the extreme left of the battle by the banks of the river</p>
    <p class=l>raged on the left, and ruled the tide of war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>scamander, where the carnage was thickest and the war-cry loudest</p>
    <p class=l>loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>round nestor and brave idomeneus.</p>
    <p class=l>and deep scamander swells with heaps of slain.<br />there nestor and idomeneus oppose</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among these hector was making</p>
    <p class=l>the warrior’s fury; there the battle glows;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great slaughter with his spear and furious driving, and was</p>
    <p class=l>there fierce on foot, or from the chariot’s height,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>destroying the ranks that were opposed to him; still the achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>his sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would have given no ground, had not alexandrus husband of lovely</p>
    <p class=l>the spouse of helen, dealing darts around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>helen stayed the prowess of machaon, shepherd of his people, by</p>
    <p class=l>had pierced machaon with a distant wound:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wounding him in the right shoulder with a triple-barbed arrow.</p>
    <p class=l>in his right shoulder the broad shaft appear’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans were in great fear that as the fight had turned</p>
    <p class=l>and trembling greece for her physician fear’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against them the trojans might take him prisoner, and idomeneus</p>
    <p class=l>to nestor then idomeneus begun:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said to nestor, “nestor son of neleus, honour to the achaean</p>
    <p class=l>“glory of greece, old neleus’ valiant son!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>name, mount your chariot at once; take machaon with you and drive</p>
    <p class=l>ascend thy chariot, haste with speed away,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your horses to the ships as fast as you can.</p>
    <p class=l>and great machaon to the ships convey;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a physician is worth</p>
    <p class=l>a wise physician skill’d our wounds to heal,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>more than several other men put together, for he can cut out<br />arrows and spread healing herbs.</p>
    <p class=l>is more than armies to the public weal.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nestor knight of gerene did as idomeneus had counselled; he at</p>
    <p class=l>old nestor mounts the seat; beside him rode</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>once mounted his chariot, and machaon son of the famed physician</p>
    <p class=l>the wounded offspring of the healing god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aesculapius, went with him.</p>
    <p class=l>he lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feet</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he lashed his horses and they flew</p>
    <p class=l>shake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>onward nothing loth towards the ships, as though of their own</p>
    <p class=l>but now cebriones, from hector’s car,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>free will.</p>
    <p class=l>survey’d the various fortune of the war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then cebriones seeing the trojans in confusion said to hector</p>
    <p class=l>“while here (he cried) the flying greeks are slain,<br />trojans on trojans yonder load the plain.<br />before great ajax see the mingled throng<br />of men and chariots driven in heaps along!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from his place beside him, “hector, here are we two fighting on</p>
    <p class=l>i know him well, distinguish’d o’er the field</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the extreme wing of the battle, while the other trojans are in</p>
    <p class=l>by the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pell-mell rout, they and their horses.<br />ajax son of telamon is</p>
    <p class=l>thither, o hector, thither urge thy steeds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>driving them before him; i know him by the breadth of his shield:</p>
    <p class=l>there danger calls, and there the combat bleeds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us turn our chariot and horses thither, where horse and foot</p>
    <p class=l>there horse and foot in mingled deaths unite,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are fighting most desperately, and where the cry of battle is</p>
    <p class=l>and groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>loudest.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the</p>
    <p class=l>thus having spoke, the driver’s lash resounds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whip they drew the chariot full speed among the achaeans and</p>
    <p class=l>swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans, over the bodies and shields of those that had fallen:</p>
    <p class=l>stung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields,<br />o’er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields.<br />the horses’ hoofs are bathed in heroes’ gore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the axle was bespattered with blood, and the rail round the car</p>
    <p class=l>and, dashing, purple all the car before;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was covered with splashes both from the horses’ hoofs and from</p>
    <p class=l>the groaning axle sable drops distils,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the tyres of the wheels.</p>
    <p class=l>and mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector tore his way through and flung<br />himself into the thick of the fight, and his presence threw the</p>
    <p class=l>here hector, plunging through the thickest fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>danaans into confusion, for his spear was not long idle;</p>
    <p class=l>broke the dark phalanx, and let in the light:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevertheless though he went among the ranks with sword and spear,</p>
    <p class=l>(by the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,<br />the ranks he scatter’d and the troops o’erthrown:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and throwing great stones, he avoided ajax son of telamon, for</p>
    <p class=l>ajax he shuns, through all the dire debate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove would have been angry with him if he had fought a better man</p>
    <p class=l>and fears that arm whose force he felt so late.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>than himself.</p>
    <p class=l>but partial jove, espousing hector’s part,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then father jove from his high throne struck fear into the heart</p>
    <p class=l>shot heaven-bred horror through the grecian’s heart;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of ajax, so that he stood there dazed and threw his shield behind</p>
    <p class=l>confused, unnerved in hector’s presence grown,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him—looking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were</p>
    <p class=l>amazed he stood, with terrors not his own.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some wild beast, and turning hither and thither but crouching</p>
    <p class=l>o’er his broad back his moony shield he threw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>slowly backwards.</p>
    <p class=l>and, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as peasants with their hounds chase a lion from</p>
    <p class=l>thus the grim lion his retreat maintains,<br />beset with watchful dogs, and shouting swains;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their stockyard, and watch by night to prevent his carrying off</p>
    <p class=l>repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the pick of their herd—he makes his greedy spring, but in vain,</p>
    <p class=l>though rage impels him, and though hunger calls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the darts from many a strong hand fall thick around him, with</p>
    <p class=l>long stands the showering darts, and missile fires;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>burning brands that scare him for all his fury, and when morning</p>
    <p class=l>then sourly slow the indignant beast retires:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>comes he slinks foiled and angry away—even so did ajax, sorely</p>
    <p class=l>so turn’d stern ajax, by whole hosts repell’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against his will, retreat angrily before the trojans, fearing for</p>
    <p class=l>while his swoln heart at every step rebell’d.<br />as the slow beast, with heavy strength endued,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ships of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>in some wide field by troops of boys pursued,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or as some lazy ass that has had many</p>
    <p class=l>though round his sides a wooden tempest rain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a cudgel broken about his back, when he into a field begins</p>
    <p class=l>crops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain;<br />thick on his hide the hollow blows resound,<br />the patient animal maintains his ground,<br />scarce from the field with all their efforts chased,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eating the corn—boys beat him but he is too many for them, and<br />though they lay about with their sticks they cannot hurt him;<br />still when he has had his fill they at last drive him from the</p>
    <p class=l>and stirs but slowly when he stirs at last:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>field—even so did the trojans and their allies pursue great ajax,</p>
    <p class=l>on ajax thus a weight of trojans hung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ever smiting the middle of his shield with their darts.</p>
    <p class=l>the strokes redoubled on his buckler rung;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now and</p>
    <p class=l>confiding now in bulky strength he stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>again he would turn and show fight, keeping back the battalions</p>
    <p class=l>now turns, and backward bears the yielding bands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the trojans, and then he would again retreat; but he prevented</p>
    <p class=l>now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>any of them from making his way to the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>and threats his followers with retorted eye.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>single-handed he</p>
    <p class=l>fix’d as the bar between two warring powers,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stood midway between the trojans and achaeans: the spears that</p>
    <p class=l>while hissing darts descend in iron showers:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sped from their hands stuck some of them in his mighty shield,</p>
    <p class=l>in his broad buckler many a weapon stood,<br />its surface bristled with a quivering wood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while many, though thirsting for his blood, fell to the ground</p>
    <p class=l>and many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ere they could reach him to the wounding of his fair flesh.</p>
    <p class=l>marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now when eurypylus the brave son of euaemon saw that ajax was</p>
    <p class=l>but bold eurypylus his aid imparts,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>being overpowered by the rain of arrows, he went up to him and</p>
    <p class=l>and dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts;<br />whose eager javelin launch’d against the foe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hurled his spear.</p>
    <p class=l>great apisaon felt the fatal blow;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he struck apisaon son of phausius in the liver</p>
    <p class=l>from his torn liver the red current flow’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>below the midriff, and laid him low.</p>
    <p class=l>and his slack knees desert their dying load.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eurypylus sprang upon him,</p>
    <p class=l>the victor rushing to despoil the dead,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and stripped the armour from his shoulders; but when alexandrus<br />saw him, he aimed an arrow at him which struck him in the right</p>
    <p class=l>from paris’ bow a vengeful arrow fled;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thigh; the arrow broke, but the point that was left in the wound</p>
    <p class=l>fix’d in his nervous thigh the weapon stood,<br />fix’d was the point, but broken was the wood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dragged on the thigh; he drew back, therefore, under cover of his</p>
    <p class=l>back to the lines the wounded greek retired,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>comrades to save his life, shouting as he did so to the danaans,</p>
    <p class=l>yet thus retreating, his associates fired:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my friends, princes and counsellors of the argives, rally to the</p>
    <p class=l>“what god, o grecians!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>defence of ajax who is being overpowered, and i doubt whether he</p>
    <p class=l>has your hearts dismay’d?<br />oh, turn to arms; ’tis ajax claims your aid.<br />this hour he stands the mark of hostile rage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will come out of the fight alive.</p>
    <p class=l>and this the last brave battle he shall wage:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hither, then, to the rescue of</p>
    <p class=l>haste, join your forces; from the gloomy grave</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great ajax son of telamon.</p>
    <p class=l>the warrior rescue, and your country save.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so did he cry when he was wounded; thereon the others came</p>
    <p class=l>thus urged the chief: a generous troop appears,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>near, and gathered round him, holding their shields upwards from</p>
    <p class=l>who spread their bucklers, and advance their spears,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their shoulders so as to give him cover.</p>
    <p class=l>to guard their wounded friend: while thus they stand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax then made towards</p>
    <p class=l>with pious care, great ajax joins the band:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them, and turned round to stand at bay as soon as he had reached</p>
    <p class=l>each takes new courage at the hero’s sight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his men.</p>
    <p class=l>the hero rallies, and renews the fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire.</p>
    <p class=l>thus raged both armies like conflicting fires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the</p>
    <p class=l>while nestor’s chariot far from fight retires:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mares of neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were bearing nestor</p>
    <p class=l>his coursers steep’d in sweat, and stain’d with gore,<br />the greeks’ preserver, great machaon, bore.<br />that hour achilles, from the topmost height</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>out of the fight, and with him machaon shepherd of his people.</p>
    <p class=l>of his proud fleet, o’erlook’d the fields of fight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles saw and took note, for he was standing on the stern of</p>
    <p class=l>his feasted eyes beheld around the plain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his ship watching the hard stress and struggle of the fight.</p>
    <p class=l>the grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>his friend machaon singled from the rest,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>called from the ship to his comrade patroclus, who heard him in</p>
    <p class=l>a transient pity touch’d his vengeful breast.<br />straight to menoetius’ much-loved son he sent:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the tent and came out looking like mars himself—here indeed was</p>
    <p class=l>graceful as mars, patroclus quits his tent;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the beginning of the ill that presently befell him.</p>
    <p class=l>in evil hour!<br />then fate decreed his doom,<br />and fix’d the date of all his woes to come.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“why,” said<br />he, “achilles, do you call me?</p>
    <p class=l>“why calls my friend?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what do you want with me?</p>
    <p class=l>thy loved injunctions lay;<br />whate’er thy will, patroclus shall obey.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>” and</p>
    <p class=l>”<br />“o first of friends!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles answered, “noble son of menoetius, man after my own</p>
    <p class=l>(pelides thus replied)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heart, i take it that i shall now have the achaeans praying at my</p>
    <p class=l>still at my heart, and ever at my side!<br />the time is come, when yon despairing host<br />shall learn the value of the man they lost:<br />now at my knees the greeks shall pour their moan,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>knees, for they are in great straits; go, patroclus, and ask</p>
    <p class=l>and proud atrides tremble on his throne.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nestor who it is that he is bearing away wounded from the field;</p>
    <p class=l>go now to nestor, and from him be taught<br />what wounded warrior late his chariot brought:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from his back i should say it was machaon son of aesculapius, but</p>
    <p class=l>for, seen at distance, and but seen behind,<br />his form recall’d machaon to my mind;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i could not see his face for the horses went by me at full</p>
    <p class=l>nor could i, through yon cloud, discern his face,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>speed.</p>
    <p class=l>the coursers pass’d me with so swift a pace.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”<br />the hero said.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set off</p>
    <p class=l>his friend obey’d with haste,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>running by the ships and tents of the achaeans.<br />when nestor and machaon had reached the tents of the son of</p>
    <p class=l>through intermingled ships and tents he pass’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neleus, they dismounted, and an esquire, eurymedon, took the</p>
    <p class=l>the chiefs descending from their car he found:</p>

    <p class=r>horses from the chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>the panting steeds eurymedon unbound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the pair then stood in the breeze by the</p>
    <p class=l>the warriors standing on the breezy shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seaside to dry the sweat from their shirts, and when they had so</p>
    <p class=l>to dry their sweat, and wash away the gore,<br />here paused a moment, while the gentle gale<br />convey’d that freshness the cool seas exhale;<br />then to consult on farther methods went,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>done they came inside and took their seats.</p>
    <p class=l>and took their seats beneath the shady tent.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fair hecamede, whom<br />nestor had had awarded to him from tenedos when achilles took it,</p>
    <p class=l>the draught prescribed, fair hecamede prepares,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mixed them a mess; she was daughter of wise arsinous, and the</p>
    <p class=l>arsinous’ daughter, graced with golden hairs:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans had given her to nestor because he excelled all of them</p>
    <p class=l>(whom to his aged arms, a royal slave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in counsel.</p>
    <p class=l>greece, as the prize of nestor’s wisdom gave:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first she set for them a fair and well-made table</p>
    <p class=l>a table first with azure feet she placed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that had feet of cyanus; on it there was a vessel of bronze and</p>
    <p class=l>whose ample orb a brazen charger graced;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>an onion to give relish to the drink, with honey and cakes of</p>
    <p class=l>honey new-press’d, the sacred flour of wheat,<br />and wholesome garlic, crown’d the savoury treat,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>barley-meal.</p>
    <p class=l>next her white hand an antique goblet brings,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there was also a cup of rare workmanship which the</p>
    <p class=l>a goblet sacred to the pylian kings</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>old man had brought with him from home, studded with bosses of</p>
    <p class=l>from eldest times: emboss’d with studs of gold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gold; it had four handles, on each of which there were two golden<br />doves feeding, and it had two feet to stand on.</p>
    <p class=l>two feet support it, and four handles hold;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>any one else</p>
    <p class=l>on each bright handle, bending o’er the brink,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would hardly have been able to lift it from the table when it was</p>
    <p class=l>in sculptured gold, two turtles seem to drink:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>full, but nestor could do so quite easily.</p>
    <p class=l>a massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him,<br />when the brisk nectar overlook’d the brim.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in this the woman, as</p>
    <p class=l>temper’d in this, the nymph of form divine</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fair as a goddess, mixed them a mess with pramnian wine; she</p>
    <p class=l>pours a large portion of the pramnian wine;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grated goat’s milk cheese into it with a bronze grater, threw in</p>
    <p class=l>with goat’s-milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a handful of white barley-meal, and having thus prepared the mess</p>
    <p class=l>and last with flour the smiling surface strows:<br />this for the wounded prince the dame prepares:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she bade them drink it.</p>
    <p class=l>the cordial beverage reverend nestor shares:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they had done so and had thus</p>
    <p class=l>salubrious draughts the warriors’ thirst allay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quenched their thirst, they fell talking with one another, and at</p>
    <p class=l>and pleasing conference beguiles the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this moment patroclus appeared at the door.</p>
    <p class=l>meantime patroclus, by achilles sent,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the old man saw him he sprang from his seat, seized his<br />hand, led him into the tent, and bade him take his place among</p>
    <p class=l>unheard approached, and stood before the tent.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them; but patroclus stood where he was and said, “noble sir, i</p>
    <p class=l>old nestor, rising then, the hero led<br />to his high seat: the chief refused and said:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may not stay, you cannot persuade me to come in; he that sent me</p>
    <p class=l>“’tis now no season for these kind delays;<br />the great achilles with impatience stays.<br />to great achilles this respect i owe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is not one to be trifled with, and he bade me ask who the wounded</p>
    <p class=l>who asks, what hero, wounded by the foe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>man was whom you were bearing away from the field.</p>
    <p class=l>was borne from combat by thy foaming steeds?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i can now see</p>
    <p class=l>with grief i see the great machaon bleeds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for myself that he is machaon, shepherd of his people.<br />i must go</p>
    <p class=l>this to report, my hasty course i bend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>back and tell achilles.<br />you, sir, know what a terrible man he is,<br />and how ready to blame even where no blame should lie.</p>
    <p class=l>thou know’st the fiery temper of my friend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and nestor answered, “why should achilles care to know how many</p>
    <p class=l>“can then the sons of greece (the sage rejoin’d)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the achaeans may be wounded?</p>
    <p class=l>excite compassion in achilles’ mind?<br />seeks he the sorrows of our host to know?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he recks not of the dismay that</p>
    <p class=l>this is not half the story of our woe.<br />tell him, not great machaon bleeds alone,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>reigns in our host; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled,</p>
    <p class=l>our bravest heroes in the navy groan,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brave diomed, son of tydeus, is wounded; so are ulysses and</p>
    <p class=l>ulysses, agamemnon, diomed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon; eurypylus has been hit with an arrow in the thigh, and<br />i have just been bringing this man from the field—he too wounded</p>
    <p class=l>and stern eurypylus, already bleed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with an arrow.</p>
    <p class=l>but, ah!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevertheless, achilles, so valiant though he be,</p>
    <p class=l>what flattering hopes i entertain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cares not and knows no ruth.</p>
    <p class=l>achilles heeds not, but derides our pain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will he wait till the ships, do what</p>
    <p class=l>even till the flames consume our fleet he stays,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we may, are in a blaze, and we perish one upon the other?</p>
    <p class=l>and waits the rising of the fatal blaze.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as for</p>
    <p class=l>chief after chief the raging foe destroys;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me, i have no strength nor stay in me any longer; would that i</p>
    <p class=l>calm he looks on, and every death enjoys.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were still young and strong as in the days when there was a fight</p>
    <p class=l>now the slow course of all-impairing time</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>between us and the men of elis about some cattle-raiding.</p>
    <p class=l>unstrings my nerves, and ends my manly prime;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i then</p>
    <p class=l>oh!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>killed itymoneus, the valiant son of hypeirochus, a dweller in</p>
    <p class=l>had i still that strength my youth possess’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>elis, as i was driving in the spoil; he was hit by a dart thrown</p>
    <p class=l>when this bold arm the epeian powers oppress’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by my hand while fighting in the front rank in defence of his</p>
    <p class=l>the bulls of elis in glad triumph led,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cows, so he fell and the country people around him were in great</p>
    <p class=l>and stretch’d the great itymonaeus dead!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fear.</p>
    <p class=l>then from my fury fled the trembling swains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we drove off a vast quantity of booty from the plain, fifty</p>
    <p class=l>and ours was all the plunder of the plains:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>herds of cattle and as many flocks of sheep; fifty droves also of</p>
    <p class=l>fifty white flocks, full fifty herds of swine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pigs, and as many wide-spreading flocks of goats.<br />of horses,</p>
    <p class=l>as many goats, as many lowing kine:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moreover, we seized a hundred and fifty, all of them mares, and<br />many had foals running with them.</p>
    <p class=l>and thrice the number of unrivall’d steeds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all these did we drive by night<br />to pylus, the city of neleus, taking them within the city; and</p>
    <p class=l>all teeming females, and of generous breeds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the heart of neleus was glad in that i had taken so much, though<br />it was the first time i had ever been in the field.</p>
    <p class=l>these, as my first essay of arms, i won;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at daybreak</p>
    <p class=l>old neleus gloried in his conquering son.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the heralds went round crying that all in elis to whom there was<br />a debt owing should come; and the leading pylians assembled to</p>
    <p class=l>thus elis forced, her long arrears restored,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>divide the spoils.<br />there were many to whom the epeans owed</p>
    <p class=l>and shares were parted to each pylian lord.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chattels, for we men of pylus were few and had been oppressed<br />with wrong; in former years hercules had come, and had laid his</p>
    <p class=l>the state of pyle was sunk to last despair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hand heavy upon us, so that all our best men had perished.</p>
    <p class=l>when the proud elians first commenced the war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neleus</p>
    <p class=l>for neleus’ sons alcides’ rage had slain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had had twelve sons, but i alone was left; the others had all</p>
    <p class=l>of twelve bold brothers, i alone remain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>been killed.<br />the epeans presuming upon all this had looked down<br />upon us and had done us much evil.</p>
    <p class=l>oppress’d, we arm’d; and now this conquest gain’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my father chose a herd of<br />cattle and a great flock of sheep—three hundred in all—and he</p>
    <p class=l>my sire three hundred chosen sheep obtain’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>took their shepherds with him, for there was a great debt due to</p>
    <p class=l>(that large reprisal he might justly claim,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him in elis, to wit four horses, winners of prizes.<br />they and<br />their chariots with them had gone to the games and were to run</p>
    <p class=l>for prize defrauded, and insulted fame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for a tripod, but king augeas took them, and sent back their</p>
    <p class=l>when elis’ monarch, at the public course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>driver grieving for the loss of his horses.</p>
    <p class=l>detain’d his chariot, and victorious horse.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neleus was angered by</p>
    <p class=l>)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what he had both said and done, and took great value in return,<br />but he divided the rest, that no man might have less than his<br />full share.</p>
    <p class=l>the rest the people shared; myself survey’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“thus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the gods</p>
    <p class=l>the just partition, and due victims paid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>throughout the city; but three days afterwards the epeans came in</p>
    <p class=l>three days were past, when elis rose to war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a body, many in number, they and their chariots, in full array,</p>
    <p class=l>with many a courser, and with many a car;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and with them the two moliones in their armour, though they were</p>
    <p class=l>the sons of actor at their army’s head</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>still lads and unused to fighting.</p>
    <p class=l>(young as they were) the vengeful squadrons led.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now there is a certain town,</p>
    <p class=l>high on the rock fair thryoessa stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thryoessa, perched upon a rock on the river alpheus, the border</p>
    <p class=l>our utmost frontier on the pylian lands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>city of pylus.</p>
    <p class=l>not far the streams of famed alphaeus flow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this they would destroy, and pitched their camp</p>
    <p class=l>the stream they pass’d, and pitch’d their tents below.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about it, but when they had crossed their whole plain, minerva<br />darted down by night from olympus and bade us set ourselves in</p>
    <p class=l>pallas, descending in the shades of night,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>array; and she found willing soldiers in pylos, for the men meant</p>
    <p class=l>alarms the pylians and commands the fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fighting.</p>
    <p class=l>each burns for fame, and swells with martial pride,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neleus would not let me arm, and hid my horses, for he</p>
    <p class=l>myself the foremost; but my sire denied;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said that as yet i could know nothing about war; nevertheless</p>
    <p class=l>fear’d for my youth, exposed to stern alarms;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva so ordered the fight that, all on foot as i was, i fought</p>
    <p class=l>and stopp’d my chariot, and detain’d my arms.<br />my sire denied in vain: on foot i fled</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among our mounted forces and vied with the foremost of them.</p>
    <p class=l>amidst our chariots; for the goddess led.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there is a river minyeius that falls into the sea near arene, and</p>
    <p class=l>“along fair arene’s delightful plain<br />soft minyas rolls his waters to the main:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there they that were mounted (and i with them) waited till<br />morning, when the companies of foot soldiers came up with us in</p>
    <p class=l>there, horse and foot, the pylian troops unite,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>force.</p>
    <p class=l>and sheathed in arms, expect the dawning light.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thence in full panoply and equipment we came towards noon</p>
    <p class=l>thence, ere the sun advanced his noon-day flame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to the sacred waters of the alpheus, and there we offered victims</p>
    <p class=l>to great alphaeus’ sacred source we came.<br />there first to jove our solemn rites were paid;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to almighty jove, with a bull to alpheus, another to neptune, and</p>
    <p class=l>an untamed heifer pleased the blue-eyed maid;<br />a bull, alphaeus; and a bull was slain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a herd-heifer to minerva.</p>
    <p class=l>to the blue monarch of the watery main.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after this we took supper in our<br />companies, and laid us down to rest each in his armour by the<br />river.</p>
    <p class=l>in arms we slept, beside the winding flood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“the epeans were beleaguering the city and were determined to</p>
    <p class=l>while round the town the fierce epeians stood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>take it, but ere this might be there was a desperate fight in</p>
    <p class=l>soon as the sun, with all-revealing ray,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>store for them.<br />when the sun’s rays began to fall upon the earth</p>
    <p class=l>flamed in the front of heaven, and gave the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we joined battle, praying to jove and to minerva, and when the</p>
    <p class=l>bright scenes of arms, and works of war appear;<br />the nations meet; there pylos, elis here.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight had begun, i was the first to kill my man and take his</p>
    <p class=l>the first who fell, beneath my javelin bled;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses—to wit the warrior mulius.<br />he was son-in-law to augeas,<br />having married his eldest daughter, golden-haired agamede, who</p>
    <p class=l>king augias’ son, and spouse of agamede:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>knew the virtues of every herb which grows upon the face of the</p>
    <p class=l>(she that all simples’ healing virtues knew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>earth.</p>
    <p class=l>and every herb that drinks the morning dew:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i speared him as he was coming towards me, and when he<br />fell headlong in the dust, i sprang upon his chariot and took my<br />place in the front ranks.</p>
    <p class=l>i seized his car, the van of battle led;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the epeans fled in all directions when</p>
    <p class=l>the epeians saw, they trembled, and they fled.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they saw the captain of their horsemen (the best man they had)</p>
    <p class=l>the foe dispersed, their bravest warrior kill’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>laid low, and i swept down on them like a whirlwind, taking fifty</p>
    <p class=l>fierce as the whirlwind now i swept the field:<br />full fifty captive chariots graced my train;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariots—and in each of them two men bit the dust, slain by my<br />spear.</p>
    <p class=l>two chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i should have even killed the two moliones, sons of actor,<br />unless their real father, neptune lord of the earthquake, had</p>
    <p class=l>then actor’s sons had died, but neptune shrouds</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hidden them in a thick mist and borne them out of the fight.</p>
    <p class=l>the youthful heroes in a veil of clouds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon jove vouchsafed the pylians a great victory, for we</p>
    <p class=l>o’er heapy shields, and o’er the prostrate throng,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chased them far over the plain, killing the men and bringing in</p>
    <p class=l>collecting spoils, and slaughtering all along,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their armour, till we had brought our horses to buprasium, rich</p>
    <p class=l>through wide buprasian fields we forced the foes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in wheat, and to the olenian rock, with the hill that is called</p>
    <p class=l>where o’er the vales the olenian rocks arose;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alision, at which point minerva turned the people back.</p>
    <p class=l>till pallas stopp’d us where alisium flows.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there i</p>
    <p class=l>even there the hindmost of the rear i slay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>slew the last man and left him; then the achaeans drove their</p>
    <p class=l>and the same arm that led concludes the day;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses back from buprasium to pylos and gave thanks to jove among</p>
    <p class=l>then back to pyle triumphant take my way.<br />there to high jove were public thanks assign’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the gods, and among mortal men to nestor.</p>
    <p class=l>as first of gods; to nestor, of mankind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“such was i among my peers, as surely as ever was, but achilles</p>
    <p class=l>such then i was, impell’d by youthful blood;<br />so proved my valour for my country’s good.<br />“achilles with unactive fury glows,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is for keeping all his valour for himself; bitterly will he rue</p>
    <p class=l>and gives to passion what to greece he owes.<br />how shall he grieve, when to the eternal shade</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it hereafter when the host is being cut to pieces.</p>
    <p class=l>her hosts shall sink, nor his the power to aid!</p>

    <p class=r>my good</p>
    <p class=l>o friend!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>friend, did not menoetius charge you thus, on the day when he</p>
    <p class=l>my memory recalls the day,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sent you from phthia to agamemnon?</p>
    <p class=l>when, gathering aids along the grecian sea,</p>

    <p class=r>ulysses and i were in the<br />house, inside, and heard all that he said to you; for we came to<br />the fair house of peleus while beating up recruits throughout all<br />achaea, and when we got there we found menoetius and yourself,</p>
    <p class=l>i, and ulysses, touch’d at phthia’s port,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and achilles with you.<br />the old knight peleus was in the outer</p>
    <p class=l>and entered peleus’ hospitable court.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>court, roasting the fat thigh-bones of a heifer to jove the lord<br />of thunder; and he held a gold chalice in his hand from which he</p>
    <p class=l>a bull to jove he slew in sacrifice,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>poured drink-offerings of wine over the burning sacrifice.</p>
    <p class=l>and pour’d libations on the flaming thighs.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you</p>
    <p class=l>thyself, achilles, and thy reverend sire</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two were busy cutting up the heifer, and at that moment we stood</p>
    <p class=l>menoetius, turn’d the fragments on the fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at the gates, whereon achilles sprang to his feet, led us by the<br />hand into the house, placed us at table, and set before us such<br />hospitable entertainment as guests expect.<br />when we had satisfied</p>
    <p class=l>achilles sees us, to the feast invites;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ourselves with meat and drink, i said my say and urged both of</p>
    <p class=l>social we sit, and share the genial rites.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you to join us.</p>
    <p class=l>we then explained the cause on which we came,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you were ready enough to do so, and the two old<br />men charged you much and straitly.</p>
    <p class=l>urged you to arms, and found you fierce for fame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>old peleus bade his son</p>
    <p class=l>your ancient fathers generous precepts gave;<br />peleus said only this:—‘my son!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles fight ever among the foremost and outvie his peers,</p>
    <p class=l>be brave.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while menoetius the son of actor spoke thus to you: ‘my son,’</p>
    <p class=l>’</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said he, ‘achilles is of nobler birth than you are, but you are</p>
    <p class=l>menoetius thus: ‘though great achilles shine<br />in strength superior, and of race divine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>older than he, though he is far the better man of the two.</p>
    <p class=l>yet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>counsel him wisely, guide him in the right way, and he will</p>
    <p class=l>let thy just counsels aid, and rule thy friend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>follow you to his own profit.</p>
    <p class=l>’</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>’ thus did your father charge you,</p>
    <p class=l>thus spoke your father at thessalia’s court:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but you have forgotten; nevertheless, even now, say all this to</p>
    <p class=l>words now forgot, though now of vast import.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles if he will listen to you.</p>
    <p class=l>ah!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who knows but with heaven’s<br />help you may talk him over, for it is good to take a friend’s</p>
    <p class=l>try the utmost that a friend can say:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>advice.</p>
    <p class=l>such gentle force the fiercest minds obey;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if, however, he is fearful about some oracle, or if his</p>
    <p class=l>some favouring god achilles’ heart may move;<br />though deaf to glory, he may yield to love.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mother has told him something from jove, then let him send you,</p>
    <p class=l>if some dire oracle his breast alarm,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and let the rest of the myrmidons follow with you, if perchance</p>
    <p class=l>if aught from heaven withhold his saving arm,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you may bring light and saving to the danaans.</p>
    <p class=l>some beam of comfort yet on greece may shine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and let him send</p>
    <p class=l>if thou but lead the myrmidonian line;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you into battle clad in his own armour, that the trojans may</p>
    <p class=l>clad in achilles’ arms, if thou appear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mistake you for him and leave off fighting; the sons of the<br />achaeans may thus have time to get their breath, for they are<br />hard pressed and there is little breathing time in battle.</p>
    <p class=l>proud troy may tremble, and desist from war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you,</p>
    <p class=l>press’d by fresh forces, her o’er-labour’d train</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who are fresh, might easily drive a tired enemy back to his walls<br />and away from the tents and ships.</p>
    <p class=l>shall seek their walls, and greece respire again.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he moved the heart of patroclus, who set off</p>
    <p class=l>this touch’d his generous heart, and from the tent</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>running by the line of the ships to achilles, descendant of</p>
    <p class=l>along the shore with hasty strides he went;<br />soon as he came, where, on the crowded strand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeacus.</p>
    <p class=l>the public mart and courts of justice stand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had got as far as the ships of ulysses, where was</p>
    <p class=l>where the tall fleet of great ulysses lies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their place of assembly and court of justice, with their altars</p>
    <p class=l>and altars to the guardian gods arise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dedicated to the gods, eurypylus son of euaemon, met him, wounded</p>
    <p class=l>there, sad, he met the brave euaemon’s son,<br />large painful drops from all his members run;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the thigh with an arrow, and limping out of the fight.</p>
    <p class=l>an arrow’s head yet rooted in his wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sweat</p>
    <p class=l>the sable blood in circles mark’d the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rained from his head and shoulders, and black blood welled from</p>
    <p class=l>as faintly reeling he confess’d the smart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his cruel wound, but his mind did not wander.</p>
    <p class=l>weak was his pace, but dauntless was his heart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of</p>
    <p class=l>divine compassion touch’d patroclus’ breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menoetius when he saw him had compassion upon him and spoke</p>
    <p class=l>who, sighing, thus his bleeding friend address’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>piteously saying, “o unhappy princes and counsellors of the</p>
    <p class=l>“ah, hapless leaders of the grecian host!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>danaans, are you then doomed to feed the hounds of troy with your</p>
    <p class=l>thus must ye perish on a barbarous coast?<br />is this your fate, to glut the dogs with gore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fat, far from your friends and your native land?</p>

    <p class=l>shall greece yet stand?<br />resists she yet the raging hector’s hand?<br />or are her heroes doom’d to die with shame,<br />and this the period of our wars and fame?</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wounded eurypylus made answer, “noble patroclus, there is no hope</p>
    <p class=l>eurypylus replies: “no more, my friend;<br />greece is no more!</p>

    <p class=r>“hero eurypylus,” replied the brave son of menoetius, “how may</p>

    <p class=r>with this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the</p>

    <p class=r>the sharp arrow from his thigh; he washed the black blood from</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus cut the forky steel away:</p>

    <p class=r>the wound with warm water; he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing<br />it between his hands, and spread it upon the wound; this was a</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>virtuous herb which killed all pain; so the wound presently dried</p>

    <p class=r>so the son of menoetius was attending to the hurt of eurypylus</p>

    <p class=r>so long as hector lived and achilles nursed his<br />anger, and so long as the city of priam remained untaken, the<br />great wall of the achaeans stood firm; but when the bravest of</p>

    <p class=r>scatter them, and they fall back as often as he does so—even so</p>

    <p class=r>side, above which there were the sharp stakes that the sons of</p>
    <p class=l>and bristled thick with sharpen’d stakes below.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans had planted so close and strong as a defence against</p>
    <p class=l>the foot alone this strong defence could force,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all who would assail it; a horse, therefore, could not get into<br />it and draw his chariot after him, but those who were on foot<br />kept trying their very utmost.</p>
    <p class=l>and try the pass impervious to the horse.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then polydamas went up to hector</p>
    <p class=l>this saw polydamas; who, wisely brave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and said, “hector, and you other captains of the trojans and</p>
    <p class=l>restrain’d great hector, and this counsel gave:<br />“o thou, bold leader of the trojan bands!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>allies, it is madness for us to try and drive our horses across</p>
    <p class=l>and you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trench; it will be very hard to cross, for it is full of</p>
    <p class=l>what entrance here can cumbrous chariots find,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sharp stakes, and beyond these there is the wall.<br />our horses</p>
    <p class=l>the stakes beneath, the grecian walls behind?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore cannot get down into it, and would be of no use if they</p>
    <p class=l>no pass through those, without a thousand wounds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did; moreover it is a narrow place and we should come to harm.</p>
    <p class=l>no space for combat in yon narrow bounds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if, indeed, great jove is minded to help the trojans, and in his</p>
    <p class=l>proud of the favours mighty jove has shown,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>anger will utterly destroy the achaeans, i would myself gladly</p>
    <p class=l>on certain dangers we too rashly run:<br />if ’tis his will our haughty foes to tame,<br />oh may this instant end the grecian name!<br />here, far from argos, let their heroes fall,<br />and one great day destroy and bury all!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see them perish now and here far from argos; but if they should</p>
    <p class=l>but should they turn, and here oppress our train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rally and we are driven back from the ships pell-mell into the</p>
    <p class=l>what hopes, what methods of retreat remain?<br />wedged in the trench, by our own troops confused,<br />in one promiscuous carnage crush’d and bruised,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trench there will be not so much as a man get back to the city to</p>
    <p class=l>all troy must perish, if their arms prevail,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tell the tale.</p>
    <p class=l>nor shall a trojan live to tell the tale.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, therefore, let us all do as i say; let our</p>
    <p class=l>hear then, ye warriors!<br />and obey with speed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>squires hold our horses by the trench, but let us follow hector</p>
    <p class=l>back from the trenches let your steeds be led;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in a body on foot, clad in full armour, and if the day of their</p>
    <p class=l>then all alighting, wedged in firm array,<br />proceed on foot, and hector lead the way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>doom is at hand the achaeans will not be able to withstand us.</p>
    <p class=l>so greece shall stoop before our conquering power,<br />and this (if jove consent) her fatal hour.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus spoke polydamas and his saying pleased hector, who sprang in</p>
    <p class=l>[illustration: ] polydamas advising hector<br />this counsel pleased: the godlike hector sprung</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>full armour to the ground, and all the other trojans, when they</p>
    <p class=l>swift from his seat; his clanging armour rung.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saw him do so, also left their chariots.</p>
    <p class=l>the chief’s example follow’d by his train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>each man then gave his</p>
    <p class=l>each quits his car, and issues on the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses over to his charioteer in charge to hold them ready for</p>
    <p class=l>by orders strict the charioteers enjoin’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him at the trench.</p>
    <p class=l>compel the coursers to their ranks behind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then they formed themselves into companies,</p>
    <p class=l>the forces part in five distinguish’d bands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>made themselves ready, and in five bodies followed their leaders.</p>
    <p class=l>and all obey their several chiefs’ commands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>those that went with hector and polydamas were the bravest and<br />most in number, and the most determined to break through the wall</p>
    <p class=l>the best and bravest in the first conspire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and fight at the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>pant for the fight, and threat the fleet with fire:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cebriones was also joined with them as<br />third in command, for hector had left his chariot in charge of a</p>
    <p class=l>great hector glorious in the van of these,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>less valiant soldier.</p>
    <p class=l>polydamas, and brave cebriones.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the next company was led by paris,</p>
    <p class=l>before the next the graceful paris shines,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alcathous, and agenor; the third by helenus and deiphobus, two</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sons of priam, and with them was the hero asius—asius, the son of</p>
    <p class=l>in arms with these the mighty asius stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hyrtacus, whose great black horses of the breed that comes from</p>
    <p class=l>who drew from hyrtacus his noble blood,<br />and whom arisba’s yellow coursers bore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the river selleis had brought him from arisbe.</p>
    <p class=l>the coursers fed on sellè’s winding shore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas, the<br />valiant son of anchises, led the fourth; he and the two sons of<br />antenor, archelochus and acamas, men well versed in all the arts</p>
    <p class=l>antenor’s sons the fourth battalion guide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of war.</p>
    <p class=l>and great æneas, born on fountful ide.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sarpedon was captain over the allies, and took with him</p>
    <p class=l>divine sarpedon the last band obey’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glaucus and asteropaeus whom he deemed most valiant after</p>
    <p class=l>whom glaucus and asteropaeus aid.<br />next him, the bravest, at their army’s head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>himself—for he was far the best man of them all.</p>
    <p class=l>but he more brave than all the hosts he led.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these helped to<br />array one another in their ox-hide shields, and then charged</p>
    <p class=l>now with compacted shields in close array,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>straight at the danaans, for they felt sure that they would not</p>
    <p class=l>the moving legions speed their headlong way:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hold out longer and that they should themselves now fall upon the</p>
    <p class=l>already in their hopes they fire the fleet,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships.</p>
    <p class=l>and see the grecians gasping at their feet.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the rest of the trojans and their allies now followed the counsel</p>
    <p class=l>while every trojan thus, and every aid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of polydamas but asius, son of hyrtacus, would not leave his</p>
    <p class=l>the advice of wise polydamas obey’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses and his esquire behind him; in his foolhardiness he took</p>
    <p class=l>asius alone, confiding in his car,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them on with him towards the ships, nor did he fail to come by</p>
    <p class=l>his vaunted coursers urged to meet the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his end in consequence.</p>
    <p class=l>unhappy hero!<br />and advised in vain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevermore was he to return to wind-beaten</p>
    <p class=l>those wheels returning ne’er shall mark the plain;<br />no more those coursers with triumphant joy</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ilius, exulting in his chariot and his horses; ere he could do</p>
    <p class=l>restore their master to the gates of troy!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so, death of ill-omened name had overshadowed him and he had</p>
    <p class=l>black death attends behind the grecian wall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fallen by the spear of idomeneus the noble son of deucalion.</p>
    <p class=l>and great idomeneus shall boast thy fall!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>fierce to the left he drives, where from the plain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had driven towards the left wing of the ships, by which way the</p>
    <p class=l>the flying grecians strove their ships to gain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans used to return with their chariots and horses from the</p>
    <p class=l>swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>plain.<br />hither he drove and found the gates with their doors<br />opened wide, and the great bar down—for the gatemen kept them<br />open so as to let those of their comrades enter who might be</p>
    <p class=l>the gates half-open’d to receive the last.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flying towards the ships.<br />hither of set purpose did he direct his</p>
    <p class=l>thither, exulting in his force, he flies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses, and his men followed him with a loud cry, for they felt</p>
    <p class=l>his following host with clamours rend the skies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sure that the achaeans would not hold out longer, and that they<br />should now fall upon the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>to plunge the grecians headlong in the main,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>little did they know that at the</p>
    <p class=l>such their proud hopes; but all their hopes were vain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gates they should find two of the bravest chieftains, proud sons</p>
    <p class=l>to guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the fighting lapithae—the one, polypoetes, mighty son of</p>
    <p class=l>who from the lapiths’ warlike race descend;<br />this polypœtes, great perithous’ heir,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pirithous, and the other leonteus, peer of murderous mars.</p>
    <p class=l>and that leonteus, like the god of war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these<br />stood before the gates like two high oak trees upon the</p>
    <p class=l>as two tall oaks, before the wall they rise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mountains, that tower from their wide-spreading roots, and year</p>
    <p class=l>their roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies:<br />whose spreading arms with leafy honours crown’d,<br />forbid the tempest, and protect the ground;<br />high on the hills appears their stately form,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after year battle with wind and rain—even so did these two men</p>
    <p class=l>and their deep roots for ever brave the storm.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>await the onset of great asius confidently and without flinching.</p>
    <p class=l>so graceful these, and so the shock they stand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans led by him and by iamenus, orestes, adamas the son of</p>
    <p class=l>of raging asius, and his furious band.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>asius, thoon and oenomaus, raised a loud cry of battle and made</p>
    <p class=l>orestes, acamas, in front appear,<br />and œnomaus and thoon close the rear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>straight for the wall, holding their shields of dry ox-hide above</p>
    <p class=l>in vain their clamours shake the ambient fields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their heads; for a while the two defenders remained inside and</p>
    <p class=l>in vain around them beat their hollow shields;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cheered the achaeans on to stand firm in the defence of their</p>
    <p class=l>the fearless brothers on the grecians call,<br />to guard their navies, and defend the wall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships; when, however, they saw that the trojans were attacking</p>
    <p class=l>even when they saw troy’s sable troops impend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the wall, while the danaans were crying out for help and being</p>
    <p class=l>and greece tumultuous from her towers descend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>routed, they rushed outside and fought in front of the gates like</p>
    <p class=l>forth from the portals rush’d the intrepid pair,<br />opposed their breasts, and stood themselves the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two wild boars upon the mountains that abide the attack of men</p>
    <p class=l>so two wild boars spring furious from their den,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and dogs, and charging on either side break down the wood all</p>
    <p class=l>roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men;<br />on every side the crackling trees they tear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>round them tearing it up by the roots, and one can hear the</p>
    <p class=l>and root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>clattering of their tusks, till some one hits them and makes an</p>
    <p class=l>they gnash their tusks, with fire their eye-balls roll,<br />till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>end of them—even so did the gleaming bronze rattle about their</p>
    <p class=l>around their heads the whistling javelins sung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>breasts, as the weapons fell upon them; for they fought with</p>
    <p class=l>with sounding strokes their brazen targets rung;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great fury, trusting to their own prowess and to those who were</p>
    <p class=l>fierce was the fight, while yet the grecian powers</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on the wall above them.</p>
    <p class=l>maintain’d the walls, and mann’d the lofty towers:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these threw great stones at their</p>
    <p class=l>to save their fleet their last efforts they try,<br />and stones and darts in mingled tempests fly.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>assailants in defence of themselves their tents and their ships.</p>
    <p class=l>as when sharp boreas blows abroad, and brings</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the stones fell thick as the flakes of snow which some fierce</p>
    <p class=l>the dreary winter on his frozen wings;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>blast drives from the dark clouds and showers down in sheets upon<br />the earth—even so fell the weapons from the hands alike of</p>
    <p class=l>beneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snow</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans and achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>descend, and whiten all the fields below:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>helmet and shield rang out as the great</p>
    <p class=l>so fast the darts on either army pour,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stones rained upon them, and asius, the son of hyrtacus, in his</p>
    <p class=l>so down the rampires rolls the rocky shower:<br />heavy, and thick, resound the batter’d shields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dismay cried aloud and smote his two thighs.</p>
    <p class=l>and the deaf echo rattles round the fields.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“father jove,” he</p>
    <p class=l>with shame repulsed, with grief and fury driven,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cried, “of a truth you too are altogether given to lying.</p>
    <p class=l>the frantic asius thus accuses heaven:</p>

    <p class=r>slim-waisted wasps, or bees that have their nests in the rocks by</p>

    <p class=r>he spoke, but moved not the mind of jove, whose counsel it then</p>
    <p class=l>these empty accents mingled with the wind,<br />nor moved great jove’s unalterable mind;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was to give glory to hector.</p>
    <p class=l>to godlike hector and his matchless might<br />was owed the glory of the destined fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the rest of the trojans</p>
    <p class=l>like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were fighting about the other gates; i, however, am no god to be</p>
    <p class=l>and all the gates sustain’d an equal tide;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>able to tell about all these things, for the battle raged</p>
    <p class=l>through the long walls the stony showers were heard,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>everywhere about the stone wall as it were a fiery furnace.</p>
    <p class=l>the blaze of flames, the flash of arms appear’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>argives, discomfited though they were, were forced to defend</p>
    <p class=l>while greece unconquer’d kept alive the war,<br />secure of death, confiding in despair;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their ships, and all the gods who were defending the achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>and all her guardian gods, in deep dismay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were vexed in spirit; but the lapithae kept on fighting with</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>might and main.</p>
    <p class=l>the dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon polypoetes, mighty son of pirithous, hit damasus with a</p>
    <p class=l>first damasus, by polypœtes’ steel,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear upon his cheek-pierced helmet.<br />the helmet did not protect</p>
    <p class=l>pierced through his helmet’s brazen visor, fell;</p>

    <p class=r>him, for the point of the spear went through it, and broke the<br />bone, so that the brain inside was scattered about, and he died</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fighting.</p>
    <p class=l>the warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!</p>

    <p class=r>he then slew pylon and ormenus.</p>

    <p class=l>nor less leonteus strews the field with death;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of mars, killed hippomachus the son of antimachus by striking him<br />with his spear upon the girdle.</p>
    <p class=l>first through the belt hippomachus he gored,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then drew his sword and sprang</p>
    <p class=l>then sudden waved his unresisted sword:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first upon antiphates whom he killed in combat, and who fell face</p>
    <p class=l>antiphates, as through the ranks he broke,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upwards on the earth.</p>
    <p class=l>the falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after him he killed menon, iamenus, and</p>

    <p class=l>and wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by the trench, uncertain what they should do; for they had seen a</p>
    <p class=l>these on the farther bank now stood and gazed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sign from heaven when they had essayed to cross it—a soaring</p>
    <p class=l>by heaven alarm’d, by prodigies amazed:<br />a signal omen stopp’d the passing host,<br />their martial fury in their wonder lost.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eagle that flew skirting the left wing of their host, with a</p>
    <p class=l>jove’s bird on sounding pinions beat the skies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>monstrous blood-red snake in its talons still alive and</p>
    <p class=l>a bleeding serpent of enormous size,<br />his talons truss’d; alive, and curling round,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>struggling to escape.<br />the snake was still bent on revenge,<br />wriggling and twisting itself backwards till it struck the bird<br />that held it, on the neck and breast; whereon the bird being in</p>
    <p class=l>he stung the bird, whose throat received the wound:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pain, let it fall, dropping it into the middle of the host, and</p>
    <p class=l>mad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey,<br />in airy circles wings his painful way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then flew down the wind with a sharp cry.</p>
    <p class=l>floats on the winds, and rends the heaven with cries:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans were struck</p>
    <p class=l>amidst the host the fallen serpent lies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with terror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis-bearing</p>
    <p class=l>they, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove, writhing in the midst of them, and polydamas went up to</p>
    <p class=l>and jove’s portent with beating hearts behold.<br />then first polydamas the silence broke,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector and said, “hector, at our councils of war you are ever</p>
    <p class=l>long weigh’d the signal, and to hector spoke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>given to rebuke me, even when i speak wisely, as though it were</p>
    <p class=l>“how oft, my brother, thy reproach i bear,<br />for words well meant, and sentiments sincere?<br />true to those counsels which i judge the best,<br />i tell the faithful dictates of my breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not well, forsooth, that one of the people should cross your will</p>
    <p class=l>to speak his thoughts is every freeman’s right,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>either in the field or at the council board; you would have them</p>
    <p class=l>in peace, in war, in council, and in fight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>support you always: nevertheless i will say what i think will be</p>
    <p class=l>and all i move, deferring to thy sway,<br />but tends to raise that power which i obey.<br />then hear my words, nor may my words be vain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>best; let us not now go on to fight the danaans at their ships,</p>
    <p class=l>seek not this day the grecian ships to gain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for i know what will happen if this soaring eagle which skirted</p>
    <p class=l>for sure, to warn us, jove his omen sent,<br />and thus my mind explains its clear event:<br />the victor eagle, whose sinister flight</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the left wing of our host with a monstrous blood-red snake in its</p>
    <p class=l>retards our host, and fills our hearts with fright,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>talons (the snake being still alive) was really sent as an omen<br />to the trojans on their essaying to cross the trench.</p>
    <p class=l>dismiss’d his conquest in the middle skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the eagle<br />let go her hold; she did not succeed in taking it home to her</p>
    <p class=l>allow’d to seize, but not possess the prize;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>little ones, and so will it be—with ourselves; even though by a</p>
    <p class=l>thus, though we gird with fires the grecian fleet,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty effort we break through the gates and wall of the</p>
    <p class=l>though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans, and they give way before us, still we shall not return</p>
    <p class=l>toils unforeseen, and fiercer, are decreed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in good order by the way we came, but shall leave many a man<br />behind us whom the achaeans will do to death in defence of their<br />ships.</p>
    <p class=l>more woes shall follow, and more heroes bleed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus would any seer who was expert in these matters, and</p>
    <p class=l>so bodes my soul, and bids me thus advise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was trusted by the people, read the portent.</p>
    <p class=l>for thus a skilful seer would read the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector looked fiercely at him and said, “polydamas, i like not of</p>
    <p class=l>to him then hector with disdain return’d:<br />(fierce as he spoke, his eyes with fury burn’d:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your reading.</p>
    <p class=l>“are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you can find a better saying than this if you will.</p>
    <p class=l>thy will is partial, not thy reason wrong:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if, however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has</p>
    <p class=l>or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heaven robbed you of your reason.</p>
    <p class=l>sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you would have me pay no heed</p>
    <p class=l>what coward counsels would thy madness move</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to the counsels of jove, nor to the promises he made me—and he</p>
    <p class=l>against the word, the will reveal’d of jove?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bowed his head in confirmation; you bid me be ruled rather by the</p>
    <p class=l>the leading sign, the irrevocable nod,<br />and happy thunders of the favouring god,<br />these shall i slight, and guide my wavering mind</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=r>what care i whether they fly towards dawn or<br />dark, and whether they be on my right hand or on my left?</p>
    <p class=l>or where the suns arise, or where descend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us</p>
    <p class=l>to right, to left, unheeded take your way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>put our trust rather in the counsel of great jove, king of<br />mortals and immortals.</p>
    <p class=l>while i the dictates of high heaven obey.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there is one omen, and one only—that a man</p>
    <p class=l>without a sign his sword the brave man draws,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should fight for his country.</p>
    <p class=l>and asks no omen but his country’s cause.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>why are you so fearful?</p>
    <p class=l>but why should’st thou suspect the war’s success?<br />none fears it more, as none promotes it less:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>though we<br />be all of us slain at the ships of the argives you are not likely</p>
    <p class=l>though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to be killed yourself, for you are not steadfast nor courageous.</p>
    <p class=l>trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire.<br />troy and her sons may find a general grave,<br />but thou canst live, for thou canst be a slave.<br />yet should the fears that wary mind suggests</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if you will not fight, or would talk others over from doing so,</p>
    <p class=l>spread their cold poison through our soldiers’ breasts,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you shall fall forthwith before my spear.</p>
    <p class=l>my javelin can revenge so base a part,<br />and free the soul that quivers in thy heart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he led the way, and the others followed after</p>
    <p class=l>furious he spoke, and, rushing to the wall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with a cry that rent the air.</p>
    <p class=l>calls on his host; his host obey the call;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then jove the lord of thunder sent</p>
    <p class=l>with ardour follow where their leader flies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the blast of a mighty wind from the mountains of ida, that bore</p>
    <p class=l>redoubling clamours thunder in the skies.<br />jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of ide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the dust down towards the ships; he thus lulled the achaeans into</p>
    <p class=l>and drifts of dust the clouded navy hide;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>security, and gave victory to hector and to the trojans, who,</p>
    <p class=l>he fills the greeks with terror and dismay,<br />and gives great hector the predestined day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trusting to their own might and to the signs he had shown them,</p>
    <p class=l>strong in themselves, but stronger in his aid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>essayed to break through the great wall of the achaeans.<br />they</p>
    <p class=l>close to the works their rigid siege they laid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tore down the breastworks from the walls, and overthrew the</p>
    <p class=l>in vain the mounds and massy beams defend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battlements; they upheaved the buttresses, which the achaeans had</p>
    <p class=l>while these they undermine, and those they rend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>set in front of the wall in order to support it; when they had<br />pulled these down they made sure of breaking through the wall,</p>
    <p class=l>upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but the danaans still showed no sign of giving ground; they still</p>
    <p class=l>and heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fenced the battlements with their shields of ox-hide, and hurled</p>
    <p class=l>greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms;<br />the crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms,<br />shield touching shield, a long refulgent row;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their missiles down upon the foe as soon as any came below the</p>
    <p class=l>whence hissing darts, incessant, rain below.<br />the bold ajaces fly from tower to tower,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wall.</p>
    <p class=l>and rouse, with flame divine, the grecian power.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the two ajaxes went about everywhere on the walls cheering on the<br />achaeans, giving fair words to some while they spoke sharply to</p>
    <p class=l>the generous impulse every greek obeys;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>any one whom they saw to be remiss.</p>
    <p class=l>threats urge the fearful; and the valiant, praise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my friends,” they cried,</p>
    <p class=l>“fellows in arms!<br />whose deeds are known to fame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“argives one and all—good bad and indifferent, for there was</p>
    <p class=l>and you, whose ardour hopes an equal name!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>never fight yet, in which all were of equal prowess—there is now</p>
    <p class=l>since not alike endued with force or art;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>work enough, as you very well know, for all of you.</p>
    <p class=l>behold a day when each may act his part!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see that you</p>
    <p class=l>a day to fire the brave, and warm the cold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>none of you turn in flight towards the ships, daunted by the</p>
    <p class=l>to gain new glories, or augment the old.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shouting of the foe, but press forward and keep one another in</p>
    <p class=l>urge those who stand, and those who faint, excite;<br />drown hector’s vaunts in loud exhorts of fight;<br />conquest, not safety, fill the thoughts of all;<br />seek not your fleet, but sally from the wall;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heart, if it may so be that olympian jove the lord of lightning</p>
    <p class=l>so jove once more may drive their routed train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will vouchsafe us to repel our foes, and drive them back towards</p>
    <p class=l>and troy lie trembling in her walls again.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the city.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did the two go about shouting and cheering the achaeans on.</p>
    <p class=l>their ardour kindles all the grecian powers;<br />and now the stones descend in heavier showers.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as the flakes that fall thick upon a winter’s day, when jove is</p>
    <p class=l>as when high jove his sharp artillery forms,<br />and opes his cloudy magazine of storms;<br />in winter’s bleak uncomfortable reign,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minded to snow and to display these his arrows to mankind—he</p>
    <p class=l>a snowy inundation hides the plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lulls the wind to rest, and snows hour after hour till he has</p>
    <p class=l>he stills the winds, and bids the skies to sleep;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>buried the tops of the high mountains, the headlands that jut</p>
    <p class=l>then pours the silent tempest thick and deep;<br />and first the mountain-tops are cover’d o’er,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into the sea, the grassy plains, and the tilled fields of men;</p>
    <p class=l>then the green fields, and then the sandy shore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the snow lies deep upon the forelands, and havens of the grey</p>
    <p class=l>bent with the weight, the nodding woods are seen,<br />and one bright waste hides all the works of men:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sea, but the waves as they come rolling in stay it that it can<br />come no further, though all else is wrapped as with a mantle, so</p>
    <p class=l>the circling seas, alone absorbing all,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heavy are the heavens with snow—even thus thickly did the stones</p>
    <p class=l>drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fall on one side and on the other, some thrown at the trojans,</p>
    <p class=l>so from each side increased the stony rain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and some by the trojans at the achaeans; and the whole wall was<br />in an uproar.</p>
    <p class=l>and the white ruin rises o’er the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>still the trojans and brave hector would not yet have broken down</p>
    <p class=l>thus godlike hector and his troops contend<br />to force the ramparts, and the gates to rend:<br />nor troy could conquer, nor the greeks would yield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the gates and the great bar, had not jove turned his son sarpedon</p>
    <p class=l>till great sarpedon tower’d amid the field;<br />for mighty jove inspired with martial flame<br />his matchless son, and urged him on to fame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against the argives as a lion against a herd of horned cattle.</p>
    <p class=l>in arms he shines, conspicuous from afar,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>before him he held his shield of hammered bronze, that the smith</p>
    <p class=l>and bears aloft his ample shield in air;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had beaten so fair and round, and had lined with ox-hides which</p>
    <p class=l>within whose orb the thick bull-hides were roll’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he had made fast with rivets of gold all round the shield; this</p>
    <p class=l>ponderous with brass, and bound with ductile gold:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he held in front of him, and brandishing his two spears came on</p>
    <p class=l>and while two pointed javelins arm his hands,<br />majestic moves along, and leads his lycian bands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like some lion of the wilderness, who has been long famished for</p>
    <p class=l>so press’d with hunger, from the mountain’s brow<br />descends a lion on the flocks below;<br />so stalks the lordly savage o’er the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>want of meat and will dare break even into a well-fenced</p>
    <p class=l>in sullen majesty, and stern disdain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>homestead to try and get at the sheep.<br />he may find the shepherds</p>
    <p class=l>in vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>keeping watch over their flocks with dogs and spears, but he is</p>
    <p class=l>and shepherds gall him with an iron war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in no mind to be driven from the fold till he has had a try for</p>
    <p class=l>regardless, furious, he pursues his way;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it; he will either spring on a sheep and carry it off, or be hit</p>
    <p class=l>he foams, he roars, he rends the panting prey.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by a spear from some strong hand—even so was sarpedon fain to</p>
    <p class=l>resolved alike, divine sarpedon glows<br />with generous rage that drives him on the foes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>attack the wall and break down its battlements.</p>
    <p class=l>he views the towers, and meditates their fall,<br />to sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he said to</p>
    <p class=l>then casting on his friend an ardent look,<br />fired with the thirst of glory, thus he spoke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glaucus son of hippolochus, “glaucus, why in lycia do we receive</p>
    <p class=l>“why boast we, glaucus!<br />our extended reign,[226]<br />where xanthus’ streams enrich the lycian plain,<br />our numerous herds that range the fruitful field,<br />and hills where vines their purple harvest yield,<br />our foaming bowls with purer nectar crown’d,</p>

    <p class=r>especial honour as regards our place at table?</p>
    <p class=l>our feasts enhanced with music’s sprightly sound?</p>

    <p class=r>why are the<br />choicest portions served us and our cups kept brimming, and why</p>
    <p class=l>why on those shores are we with joy survey’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do men look up to us as though we were gods?</p>
    <p class=l>admired as heroes, and as gods obey’d,<br />unless great acts superior merit prove,<br />and vindicate the bounteous powers above?<br />’tis ours, the dignity they give to grace;<br />the first in valour, as the first in place;<br />that when with wondering eyes our martial bands</p>

    <p class=l>whom those that envy dare not imitate!</p>

    <p class=r>the fight, that one may say to another, ‘our princes in lycia eat</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glaucus heeded his saying, and the pair forthwith led on the host</p>
    <p class=l>he said; his words the listening chief inspire<br />with equal warmth, and rouse the warrior’s fire;<br />the troops pursue their leaders with delight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of lycians.</p>
    <p class=l>rush to the foe, and claim the promised fight.</p>

    <p class=r>menestheus son of peteos was dismayed when he saw</p>
    <p class=l>menestheus from on high the storm beheld</p>

    <p class=r>them, for it was against his part of the wall that they</p>
    <p class=l>threatening the fort, and blackening in the field:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came—bringing destruction with them; he looked along the wall for</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some chieftain to support his comrades and saw the two ajaxes,</p>

    <p class=r>men ever eager for the fray, and teucer, who had just come from<br />his tent, standing near them; but he could not make his voice</p>
    <p class=l>and saw where teucer with the ajaces stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heard by shouting to them, so great an uproar was there from</p>
    <p class=l>of fight insatiate, prodigal of blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>crashing shields and helmets and the battering of gates with a</p>
    <p class=l>in vain he calls; the din of helms and shields</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>din which reached the skies.</p>
    <p class=l>rings to the skies, and echoes through the fields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for all the gates had been closed,<br />and the trojans were hammering at them to try and break their way</p>
    <p class=l>the brazen hinges fly, the walls resound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through them.</p>
    <p class=l>heaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menestheus, therefore, sent thootes with a message</p>
    <p class=l>then thus to thoos: “hence with speed (he said),</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to ajax.</p>
    <p class=l>and urge the bold ajaces to our aid;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“run, good thootes,” he said, “and call ajax, or better</p>
    <p class=l>their strength, united, best may help to bear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>still bid both come, for it will be all over with us here</p>
    <p class=l>the bloody labours of the doubtful war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>directly; the leaders of the lycians are upon us, men who have</p>
    <p class=l>hither the lycian princes bend their course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ever fought desperately heretofore.</p>
    <p class=l>the best and bravest of the hostile force.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but if they have too much on</p>
    <p class=l>but if too fiercely there the foes contend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their hands to let them come, at any rate let ajax son of telamon</p>
    <p class=l>let telamon, at least, our towers defend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do so, and let teucer, the famous bowman, come with him.</p>
    <p class=l>and teucer haste with his unerring bow<br />to share the danger, and repel the foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the messenger did as he was told, and set off running along the</p>
    <p class=l>swift, at the word, the herald speeds along</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wall of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the lofty ramparts, through the martial throng,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he reached the ajaxes he said to them,</p>
    <p class=l>and finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“sirs, princes of the argives, the son of noble peteos bids you</p>
    <p class=l>opposed in combat on the dusty shore.<br />“ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come to him for a while and help him.</p>
    <p class=l>your aid (said thoos) peteus’ son demands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you had better both come if<br />you can, or it will be all over with him directly; the leaders of</p>
    <p class=l>your strength, united, best may help to bear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the lycians are upon him, men who have ever fought desperately</p>
    <p class=l>the bloody labours of the doubtful war:<br />thither the lycian princes bend their course,<br />the best and bravest of the hostile force.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heretofore; if you have too much on your hands to let both come,</p>
    <p class=l>but if too fiercely, here, the foes contend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at any rate let ajax, son of telamon, do so, and let teucer, the</p>
    <p class=l>at least, let telamon those towers defend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>famous bowman, come with him.</p>
    <p class=l>and teucer haste with his unerring bow<br />to share the danger, and repel the foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great ajax son of telamon heeded the message, and at once spoke</p>
    <p class=l>straight to the fort great ajax turn’d his care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to the son of oileus.</p>
    <p class=l>and thus bespoke his brothers of the war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“ajax,” said he, “do you two, yourself and</p>
    <p class=l>“now, valiant lycomede!<br />exert your might,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brave lycomedes, stay here and keep the danaans in heart to fight<br />their hardest.</p>
    <p class=l>and, brave oïleus, prove your force in fight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will go over yonder, and bear my part in the</p>
    <p class=l>to you i trust the fortune of the field,<br />till by this arm the foe shall be repell’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fray, but i will come back here at once as soon as i have given</p>
    <p class=l>that done, expect me to complete the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them the help they need.</p>
    <p class=l>then with his sevenfold shield he strode away.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this, ajax son of telamon set off, and teucer, his brother<br />by the same father, went also, with pandion to carry teucer’s</p>
    <p class=l>with equal steps bold teucer press’d the shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bow.</p>
    <p class=l>whose fatal bow the strong pandion bore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they went along inside the wall, and when they came to the</p>
    <p class=l>high on the walls appear’d the lycian powers,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tower where menestheus was (and hard pressed indeed did they find</p>
    <p class=l>like some black tempest gathering round the towers:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him) the brave captains and leaders of the lycians were storming</p>
    <p class=l>the greeks, oppress’d, their utmost force unite,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the battlements as it were a thick dark cloud, fighting in close</p>
    <p class=l>prepared to labour in the unequal fight:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quarters, and raising the battle-cry aloud.</p>
    <p class=l>the war renews, mix’d shouts and groans arise;<br />tumultuous clamour mounts, and thickens in the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first, ajax son of telamon killed brave epicles, a comrade of</p>
    <p class=l>fierce ajax first the advancing host invades,<br />and sends the brave epicles to the shades,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sarpedon, hitting him with a jagged stone that lay by the</p>
    <p class=l>sarpedon’s friend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battlements at the very top of the wall.</p>
    <p class=l>across the warrior’s way,<br />rent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as men now are, even one</p>
    <p class=l>in modern ages not the strongest swain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who is in the bloom of youth could hardly lift it with his two</p>
    <p class=l>could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hands, but ajax raised it high aloft and flung it down, smashing</p>
    <p class=l>he poised, and swung it round; then toss’d on high,<br />it flew with force, and labour’d up the sky;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>epicles’ four-crested helmet so that the bones of his head were</p>
    <p class=l>full on the lycian’s helmet thundering down,<br />the ponderous ruin crush’d his batter’d crown.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>crushed to pieces, and he fell from the high wall as though he</p>
    <p class=l>as skilful divers from some airy steep</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were diving, with no more life left in him.</p>
    <p class=l>headlong descend, and shoot into the deep,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then teucer wounded</p>
    <p class=l>so falls epicles; then in groans expires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glaucus the brave son of hippolochus as he was coming on to</p>
    <p class=l>and murmuring to the shades the soul retires.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>attack the wall.</p>
    <p class=l>while to the ramparts daring glaucus drew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he saw his shoulder bare and aimed an arrow at</p>
    <p class=l>from teucer’s hand a winged arrow flew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it, which made glaucus leave off fighting.</p>
    <p class=l>the bearded shaft the destined passage found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon he sprang</p>
    <p class=l>and on his naked arm inflicts a wound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>covertly down for fear some of the achaeans might see that he was</p>
    <p class=l>the chief, who fear’d some foe’s insulting boast<br />might stop the progress of his warlike host,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wounded and taunt him.</p>
    <p class=l>conceal’d the wound, and, leaping from his height</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sarpedon was stung with grief when he saw</p>
    <p class=l>retired reluctant from the unfinish’d fight.<br />divine sarpedon with regret beheld</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glaucus leave him, still he did not leave off fighting, but aimed</p>
    <p class=l>disabled glaucus slowly quit the field;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his spear at alcmaon the son of thestor and hit him.</p>
    <p class=l>his beating breast with generous ardour glows,<br />he springs to fight, and flies upon the foes.<br />alcmaon first was doom’d his force to feel;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he drew his</p>
    <p class=l>deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear back again and alcmaon came down headlong after it with his</p>
    <p class=l>then from the yawning wound with fury tore<br />the spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bronzed armour rattling round him.</p>
    <p class=l>down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,<br />his brazen armour rings against the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then sarpedon seized the</p>
    <p class=l>swift to the battlement the victor flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battlement in his strong hands, and tugged at it till it all gave</p>
    <p class=l>tugs with full force, and every nerve applies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>way together, and a breach was made through which many might</p>
    <p class=l>it shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pass.</p>
    <p class=l>the rolling ruins smoke along the field.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax and teucer then both of them attacked him.</p>
    <p class=l>a mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>teucer hit him</p>
    <p class=l>and, like a deluge, rushes in the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with an arrow on the band that bore the shield which covered his</p>
    <p class=l>at once bold teucer draws the twanging bow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body, but jove saved his son from destruction that he might not<br />fall by the ships’ sterns.<br />meanwhile ajax sprang on him and</p>
    <p class=l>and ajax sends his javelin at the foe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pierced his shield, but the spear did not go clean through,</p>
    <p class=l>fix’d in his belt the feather’d weapon stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>though it hustled him back that he could come on no further.</p>
    <p class=l>and through his buckler drove the trembling wood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>but jove was present in the dire debate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore retired a little space from the battlement, yet without</p>
    <p class=l>to shield his offspring, and avert his fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>losing all his ground, for he still thought to cover himself with</p>
    <p class=l>the prince gave back, not meditating flight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glory.</p>
    <p class=l>but urging vengeance, and severer fight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he turned round and shouted to the brave lycians</p>
    <p class=l>then raised with hope, and fired with glory’s charms,<br />his fainting squadrons to new fury warms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saying, “lycians, why do you thus fail me?</p>
    <p class=l>“o where, ye lycians, is the strength you boast?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for all my prowess i</p>
    <p class=l>your former fame and ancient virtue lost!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cannot break through the wall and open a way to the ships</p>
    <p class=l>the breach lies open, but your chief in vain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>single-handed.</p>
    <p class=l>attempts alone the guarded pass to gain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come close on behind me, for the more there are of</p>
    <p class=l>unite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>us the better.</p>
    <p class=l>the force of powerful union conquers all.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the lycians, shamed by his rebuke, pressed closer round him who</p>
    <p class=l>this just rebuke inflamed the lycian crew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was their counsellor and their king.</p>
    <p class=l>they join, they thicken, and the assault renew:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the argives on their part<br />got their men in fighting order within the wall, and there was a</p>
    <p class=l>unmoved the embodied greeks their fury dare,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deadly struggle between them.</p>
    <p class=l>and fix’d support the weight of all the war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the lycians could not break through</p>
    <p class=l>nor could the greeks repel the lycian powers,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the wall and force their way to the ships, nor could the danaans</p>
    <p class=l>nor the bold lycians force the grecian towers.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drive the lycians from the wall now that they had once reached<br />it.</p>
    <p class=l>as on the confines of adjoining grounds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as two men, measuring-rods in hand, quarrel about their<br />boundaries in a field that they own in common, and stickle for</p>
    <p class=l>two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their rights though they be but in a mere strip, even so did the</p>
    <p class=l>they tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battlements now serve as a bone of contention, and they beat one</p>
    <p class=l>one foot, one inch, of the contended field;<br />thus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>another’s round shields for their possession.</p>
    <p class=l>nor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many a man’s body<br />was wounded with the pitiless bronze, as he turned round and<br />bared his back to the foe, and many were struck clean through</p>
    <p class=l>their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their shields; the wall and battlements were everywhere deluged</p>
    <p class=l>loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound;<br />the copious slaughter covers all the shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with the blood alike of trojans and of achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>and the high ramparts drip with human gore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but even so the</p>
    <p class=l>as when two scales are charged with doubtful loads,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans could not rout the achaeans, who still held on; and as</p>
    <p class=l>from side to side the trembling balance nods,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some honest hard-working woman weighs wool in her balance and</p>
    <p class=l>(while some laborious matron, just and poor,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sees that the scales be true, for she would gain some pitiful</p>
    <p class=l>with nice exactness weighs her woolly store,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>earnings for her little ones, even so was the fight balanced</p>
    <p class=l>till poised aloft, the resting beam suspends<br />each equal weight; nor this, nor that, descends:[227]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>evenly between them till the time came when jove gave the greater</p>
    <p class=l>so stood the war, till hector’s matchless might,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glory to hector son of priam, who was first to spring towards the</p>
    <p class=l>with fates prevailing, turn’d the scale of fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wall of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had done so, he cried aloud to the</p>
    <p class=l>and fires his host with loud repeated cries.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans, “up, trojans, break the wall of the argives, and fling</p>
    <p class=l>“advance, ye trojans!<br />lend your valiant hands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fire upon their ships.</p>
    <p class=l>haste to the fleet, and toss the blazing brands!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight</p>
    <p class=l>they hear, they run; and, gathering at his call,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at the wall as he had bidden them, and scaled the battlements</p>
    <p class=l>raise scaling engines, and ascend the wall:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with sharp spears in their hands.</p>
    <p class=l>around the works a wood of glittering spears<br />shoots up, and all the rising host appears.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector laid hold of a stone</p>
    <p class=l>a ponderous stone bold hector heaved to throw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that lay just outside the gates and was thick at one end but</p>
    <p class=l>pointed above, and rough and gross below:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pointed at the other; two of the best men in a town, as men now</p>
    <p class=l>not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,<br />such men as live in these degenerate days:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are, could hardly raise it from the ground and put it on to a<br />waggon, but hector lifted it quite easily by himself, for the son</p>
    <p class=l>yet this, as easy as a swain could bear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of scheming saturn made it light for him.</p>
    <p class=l>the snowy fleece, he toss’d, and shook in air;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as a shepherd picks up<br />a ram’s fleece with one hand and finds it no burden, so easily</p>
    <p class=l>for jove upheld, and lighten’d of its load</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did hector lift the great stone and drive it right at the doors</p>
    <p class=l>the unwieldy rock, the labour of a god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that closed the gates so strong and so firmly set.<br />these doors</p>
    <p class=l>thus arm’d, before the folded gates he came,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were double and high, and were kept closed by two cross-bars to</p>
    <p class=l>of massy substance, and stupendous frame;<br />with iron bars and brazen hinges strong,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which there was but one key.</p>
    <p class=l>on lofty beams of solid timber hung:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had got close up to them,<br />hector strode towards them that his blow might gain in force and<br />struck them in the middle, leaning his whole weight against them.</p>
    <p class=l>then thundering through the planks with forceful sway,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he broke both hinges, and the stone fell inside by reason of its<br />great weight.</p>
    <p class=l>drives the sharp rock; the solid beams give way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the portals re-echoed with the sound, the bars held<br />no longer, and the doors flew open, one one way, and the other</p>
    <p class=l>the folds are shatter’d; from the crackling door</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the other, through the force of the blow.</p>
    <p class=l>leap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then brave hector</p>
    <p class=l>now rushing in, the furious chief appears,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>leaped inside with a face as dark as that of flying night.</p>
    <p class=l>gloomy as night!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>[228] and shakes two shining spears:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gleaming bronze flashed fiercely about his body and he had two</p>
    <p class=l>a dreadful gleam from his bright armour came,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spears in his hand.</p>
    <p class=l>and from his eye-balls flash’d the living flame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>none but a god could have withstood him as he</p>
    <p class=l>he moves a god, resistless in his course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flung himself into the gateway, and his eyes glared like fire.</p>
    <p class=l>and seems a match for more than mortal force.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he turned round towards the trojans and called on them to</p>
    <p class=l>then pouring after, through the gaping space,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>scale the wall, and they did as he bade them—some of them at once</p>
    <p class=l>a tide of trojans flows, and fills the place;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>climbing over the wall, while others passed through the gates.</p>
    <p class=l>the greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the danaans then fled panic-stricken towards their ships, and all</p>
    <p class=l>the shore is heap’d with death, and tumult rends the sky.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was uproar and confusion.</p>

    <p class=r>neptune helps the achaeans—the feats of idomeneus—hector at the</p>
    <p class=l>the fourth battle continued, in which neptune assists the greeks: the<br />acts of idomeneus.<br />neptune, concerned for the loss of the grecians, upon seeing the<br />fortification forced by hector, (who had entered the gate near the<br />station of the ajaces,) assumes the shape of calchas, and inspires<br />those heroes to oppose him: then, in the form of one of the generals,</p>

    <p class=l>encourages the other greeks who had retired to their vessels.<br />the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now when jove had thus brought hector and the trojans to the</p>
    <p class=l>ajaces form their troops in a close phalanx, and put a stop to hector<br />and the trojans.<br />several deeds of valour are performed; meriones,<br />losing his spear in the encounter, repairs to seek another at the tent<br />of idomeneus: this occasions a conversation between those two warriors,<br />who return together to the battle.<br />idomeneus signalizes his courage<br />above the rest; he kills othryoneus, asius, and alcathous: deiphobus<br />and æneas march against him, and at length idomeneus retires.<br />menelaus<br />wounds helenus, and kills pisander.<br />the trojans are repulsed on the<br />left wing; hector still keeps his ground against the ajaces, till,<br />being galled by the locrian slingers and archers, polydamas advises to<br />call a council of war: hector approves of his advice, but goes first to<br />rally the trojans; upbraids paris, rejoins polydamas, meets ajax again,<br />and renews the attack.<br />the eight-and-twentieth day still continues.<br />the scene is between<br />the grecian wall and the sea-shore.<br />when now the thunderer on the sea-beat coast<br />had fix’d great hector and his conquering host,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships, he left them to their never-ending toil, and turned his</p>
    <p class=l>he left them to the fates, in bloody fray<br />to toil and struggle through the well-fought day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>keen eyes away, looking elsewhither towards the horse-breeders of</p>
    <p class=l>then turn’d to thracia from the field of fight<br />those eyes that shed insufferable light,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thrace, the mysians, fighters at close quarters, the noble</p>
    <p class=l>to where the mysians prove their martial force,<br />and hardy thracians tame the savage horse;<br />and where the far-famed hippomolgian strays,<br />renown’d for justice and for length of days;[229]<br />thrice happy race!<br />that, innocent of blood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hippemolgi, who live on milk, and the abians, justest of mankind.</p>
    <p class=l>from milk, innoxious, seek their simple food:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he no longer turned so much as a glance towards troy, for he did</p>
    <p class=l>jove sees delighted; and avoids the scene</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not think that any of the immortals would go and help either</p>
    <p class=l>of guilty troy, of arms, and dying men:<br />no aid, he deems, to either host is given,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans or danaans.</p>
    <p class=l>while his high law suspends the powers of heaven.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but king neptune had kept no blind look-out; he had been looking</p>
    <p class=l>meantime the monarch of the watery main<br />observed the thunderer, nor observed in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>admiringly on the battle from his seat on the topmost crests of</p>
    <p class=l>in samothracia, on a mountain’s brow,<br />whose waving woods o’erhung the deeps below,<br />he sat; and round him cast his azure eyes<br />where ida’s misty tops confusedly rise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wooded samothrace, whence he could see all ida, with the city of</p>
    <p class=l>below, fair ilion’s glittering spires were seen;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam and the ships of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the crowded ships and sable seas between.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he had come from under the</p>
    <p class=l>there, from the crystal chambers of the main</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sea and taken his place here, for he pitied the achaeans who were</p>
    <p class=l>emerged, he sat, and mourn’d his argives slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>being overcome by the trojans; and he was furiously angry with</p>
    <p class=l>at jove incensed, with grief and fury stung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove.</p>
    <p class=l>prone down the rocky steep he rush’d along;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>presently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and as</p>
    <p class=l>fierce as he pass’d, the lofty mountains nod,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he strode swiftly onwards the high hills and the forest quaked</p>
    <p class=l>the forest shakes; earth trembled as he trod,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beneath the tread of his immortal feet.</p>
    <p class=l>and felt the footsteps of the immortal god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>three strides he took,</p>
    <p class=l>from realm to realm three ample strides he took,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and with the fourth he reached his goal—aegae, where is his</p>
    <p class=l>and, at the fourth, the distant ægae shook.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glittering golden palace, imperishable, in the depths of the sea.</p>
    <p class=l>far in the bay his shining palace stands,<br />eternal frame!<br />not raised by mortal hands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he got there, he yoked his fleet brazen-footed steeds with</p>
    <p class=l>this having reach’d, his brass-hoof’d steeds he reins,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their manes of gold all flying in the wind; he clothed himself in</p>
    <p class=l>fleet as the winds, and deck’d with golden manes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>raiment of gold, grasped his gold whip, and took his stand upon</p>
    <p class=l>refulgent arms his mighty limbs infold,<br />immortal arms of adamant and gold.<br />he mounts the car, the golden scourge applies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>he sits superior, and the chariot flies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he went his way over the waves the sea-monsters</p>
    <p class=l>his whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>left their lairs, for they knew their lord, and came gambolling</p>
    <p class=l>the enormous monsters rolling o’er the deep</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>round him from every quarter of the deep, while the sea in her</p>
    <p class=l>gambol around him on the watery way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gladness opened a path before his chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>and heavy whales in awkward measures play;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so lightly did the</p>
    <p class=l>the sea subsiding spreads a level plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses fly that the bronze axle of the car was not even wet</p>
    <p class=l>exults, and owns the monarch of the main;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beneath it; and thus his bounding steeds took him to the ships of</p>
    <p class=l>the parting waves before his coursers fly;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the wondering waters leave his axle dry.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea</p>
    <p class=l>deep in the liquid regions lies a cave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>midway between tenedos and rocky imbrus; here neptune lord of the</p>
    <p class=l>between where tenedos the surges lave,<br />and rocky imbrus breaks the rolling wave:<br />there the great ruler of the azure round</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>earthquake stayed his horses, unyoked them, and set before them</p>
    <p class=l>stopp’d his swift chariot, and his steeds unbound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their ambrosial forage.<br />he hobbled their feet with hobbles of</p>
    <p class=l>fed with ambrosial herbage from his hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gold which none could either unloose or break, so that they might</p>
    <p class=l>and link’d their fetlocks with a golden band,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stay there in that place until their lord should return.</p>
    <p class=l>infrangible, immortal: there they stay:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this<br />done he went his way to the host of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the father of the floods pursues his way:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now the trojans followed hector son of priam in close array like</p>
    <p class=l>where, like a tempest, darkening heaven around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a storm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and</p>
    <p class=l>or fiery deluge that devours the ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>raising the cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the</p>
    <p class=l>the impatient trojans, in a gloomy throng,<br />embattled roll’d, as hector rush’d along:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships of the achaeans and kill all their chiefest heroes then and</p>
    <p class=l>to the loud tumult and the barbarous cry<br />the heavens re-echo, and the shores reply:<br />they vow destruction to the grecian name,<br />and in their hopes the fleets already flame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there.</p>
    <p class=l>but neptune, rising from the seas profound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile earth-encircling neptune lord of the earthquake</p>
    <p class=l>the god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cheered on the argives, for he had come up out of the sea and had</p>
    <p class=l>now wears a mortal form; like calchas seen,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>assumed the form and voice of calchas.</p>
    <p class=l>such his loud voice, and such his manly mien;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first he spoke to the two ajaxes, who were doing their best</p>
    <p class=l>his shouts incessant every greek inspire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>already, and said, “ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the</p>
    <p class=l>but most the ajaces, adding fire to fire.<br />[illustration: ] neptune rising from the sea</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans if you will put out all your strength and not let</p>
    <p class=l>“’tis yours, o warriors, all our hopes to raise:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yourselves be daunted.</p>
    <p class=l>oh recollect your ancient worth and praise!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i am not afraid that the trojans, who have</p>
    <p class=l>’tis yours to save us, if you cease to fear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>got over the wall in force, will be victorious in any other part,</p>
    <p class=l>flight, more than shameful, is destructive here.<br />on other works though troy with fury fall,<br />and pour her armies o’er our batter’d wall:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the achaeans can hold all of them in check, but i much fear<br />that some evil will befall us here where furious hector, who</p>
    <p class=l>there greece has strength: but this, this part o’erthrown,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>boasts himself the son of great jove himself, is leading them on</p>
    <p class=l>her strength were vain; i dread for you alone:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like a pillar of flame.</p>
    <p class=l>here hector rages like the force of fire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may some god, then, put it into your</p>
    <p class=l>vaunts of his gods, and calls high jove his sire:<br />if yet some heavenly power your breast excite,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hearts to make a firm stand here, and to incite others to do the</p>
    <p class=l>breathe in your hearts, and string your arms to fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like.<br />in this case you will drive him from the ships even though</p>
    <p class=l>greece yet may live, her threaten’d fleet maintain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he be inspired by jove himself.</p>
    <p class=l>and hector’s force, and jove’s own aid, be vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake struck</p>
    <p class=l>then with his sceptre, that the deep controls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>both of them with his sceptre and filled their hearts with</p>
    <p class=l>he touch’d the chiefs, and steel’d their manly souls:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>daring.</p>
    <p class=l>strength, not their own, the touch divine imparts,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he made their legs light and active, as also their hands<br />and their feet.</p>
    <p class=l>prompts their light limbs, and swells their daring hearts.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then, as the soaring falcon poises on the wing</p>
    <p class=l>then, as a falcon from the rocky height,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>high above some sheer rock, and presently swoops down to chase</p>
    <p class=l>her quarry seen, impetuous at the sight,<br />forth-springing instant, darts herself from high,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some bird over the plain, even so did neptune lord of the</p>
    <p class=l>shoots on the wing, and skims along the sky:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>earthquake wing his flight into the air and leave them.</p>
    <p class=l>such, and so swift, the power of ocean flew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the</p>
    <p class=l>the wide horizon shut him from their view.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two, swift ajax son of oileus was the first to know who it was</p>
    <p class=l>the inspiring god oïleus’ active son</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that had been speaking with them, and said to ajax son of</p>
    <p class=l>perceived the first, and thus to telamon:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>telamon, “ajax, this is one of the gods that dwell on olympus,</p>
    <p class=l>“some god, my friend, some god in human form</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who in the likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hard by<br />our ships.</p>
    <p class=l>favouring descends, and wills to stand the storm.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it was not calchas the seer and diviner of omens; i</p>
    <p class=l>not calchas this, the venerable seer;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>knew him at once by his feet and knees as he turned away, for the</p>
    <p class=l>short as he turned, i saw the power appear:<br />i mark’d his parting, and the steps he trod;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gods are soon recognised.</p>
    <p class=l>his own bright evidence reveals a god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moreover i feel the lust of battle burn<br />more fiercely within me, while my hands and my feet under me are</p>
    <p class=l>even now some energy divine i share,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>more eager for the fray.</p>
    <p class=l>and seem to walk on wings, and tread in air!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and ajax son of telamon answered, “i too feel my hands grasp my</p>
    <p class=l>“with equal ardour (telamon returns)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear more firmly; my strength is greater, and my feet more</p>
    <p class=l>my soul is kindled, and my bosom burns;<br />new rising spirits all my force alarm,<br />lift each impatient limb, and brace my arm.<br />this ready arm, unthinking, shakes the dart;<br />the blood pours back, and fortifies my heart:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nimble; i long, moreover, to meet furious hector son of priam,</p>
    <p class=l>singly, methinks, yon towering chief i meet,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even in single combat.</p>
    <p class=l>and stretch the dreadful hector at my feet.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle with</p>
    <p class=l>full of the god that urged their burning breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which the god had filled them.</p>
    <p class=l>the heroes thus their mutual warmth express’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the earth-encircler</p>
    <p class=l>neptune meanwhile the routed greeks inspired;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>roused the achaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships</p>
    <p class=l>who, breathless, pale, with length of labours tired,<br />pant in the ships; while troy to conquest calls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>overcome at once by hard fighting and by grief at seeing that the<br />trojans had got over the wall in force.</p>
    <p class=l>and swarms victorious o’er their yielding walls:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tears began falling from</p>
    <p class=l>trembling before the impending storm they lie,<br />while tears of rage stand burning in their eye.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their eyes as they beheld them, for they made sure that they</p>
    <p class=l>greece sunk they thought, and this their fatal hour;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should not escape destruction; but the lord of the earthquake</p>
    <p class=l>but breathe new courage as they feel the power.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>passed lightly about among them and urged their battalions to the</p>
    <p class=l>teucer and leitus first his words excite;<br />then stern peneleus rises to the fight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>front.</p>
    <p class=l>thoas, deipyrus, in arms renown’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first he went up to teucer and leitus, the hero peneleos, and</p>
    <p class=l>and merion next, the impulsive fury found;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thoas and deipyrus; meriones also and antilochus, valiant</p>
    <p class=l>last nestor’s son the same bold ardour takes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>warriors; all did he exhort.</p>
    <p class=l>while thus the god the martial fire awakes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“shame on you young argives,” he</p>
    <p class=l>“oh lasting infamy, oh dire disgrace<br />to chiefs of vigorous youth, and manly race!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cried, “it was on your prowess i relied for the saving of our</p>
    <p class=l>i trusted in the gods, and you, to see</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships; if you fight not with might and main, this very day will</p>
    <p class=l>brave greece victorious, and her navy free:<br />ah, no—the glorious combat you disclaim,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see us overcome by the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>and one black day clouds all her former fame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of a truth my eyes behold a great</p>
    <p class=l>heavens!<br />what a prodigy these eyes survey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and terrible portent which i had never thought to see—the trojans</p>
    <p class=l>unseen, unthought, till this amazing day!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at our ships—they, who were heretofore like panic-stricken hinds,</p>
    <p class=l>fly we at length from troy’s oft-conquer’d bands?<br />and falls our fleet by such inglorious hands?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the prey of jackals and wolves in a forest, with no strength but</p>
    <p class=l>a rout undisciplined, a straggling train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in flight for they cannot defend themselves.</p>
    <p class=l>not born to glories of the dusty plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hitherto the trojans</p>
    <p class=l>like frighted fawns from hill to hill pursued,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dared not for one moment face the attack of the achaeans, but now</p>
    <p class=l>a prey to every savage of the wood:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they have sallied far from their city and are fighting at our</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>very ships through the cowardice of our leader and the</p>
    <p class=l>invade your camps, involve your ships in flame?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>disaffection of the people themselves, who in their discontent</p>
    <p class=l>a change so shameful, say, what cause has wrought?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>care not to fight in defence of the ships but are being</p>
    <p class=l>the soldiers’ baseness, or the general’s fault?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>slaughtered near them.</p>
    <p class=l>fools!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>true, king agamemnon son of atreus is the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cause of our disaster by having insulted the son of peleus, still</p>
    <p class=l>’tis not your cause, achilles’ injured fame:<br />another’s is the crime, but yours the shame.<br />grant that our chief offend through rage or lust,</p>

    <p class=r>this is no reason why we should leave off fighting.</p>
    <p class=l>must you be cowards, if your king’s unjust?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us be</p>
    <p class=l>prevent this evil, and your country save:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quick to heal, for the hearts of the brave heal quickly.</p>
    <p class=l>small thought retrieves the spirits of the brave.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you do</p>
    <p class=l>think, and subdue!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ill to be thus remiss, you, who are the finest soldiers in our<br />whole army.</p>
    <p class=l>on dastards dead to fame</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i blame no man for keeping out of battle if he is a</p>
    <p class=l>i waste no anger, for they feel no shame:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>weakling, but i am indignant with such men as you are.</p>
    <p class=l>but you, the pride, the flower of all our host,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my good</p>
    <p class=l>my heart weeps blood to see your glory lost!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>friends, matters will soon become even worse through this</p>
    <p class=l>nor deem this day, this battle, all you lose;<br />a day more black, a fate more vile, ensues.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>slackness; think, each one of you, of his own honour and credit,</p>
    <p class=l>let each reflect, who prizes fame or breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the hazard of the fight is extreme.</p>
    <p class=l>on endless infamy, on instant death:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great hector is now</p>
    <p class=l>for, lo!<br />the fated time, the appointed shore:<br />hark!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fighting at our ships; he has broken through the gates and the</p>
    <p class=l>the gates burst, the brazen barriers roar!<br />impetuous hector thunders at the wall;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strong bolt that held them.</p>
    <p class=l>the hour, the spot, to conquer, or to fall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did the earth-encircler address the achaeans and urge them</p>
    <p class=l>these words the grecians’ fainting hearts inspire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on.</p>
    <p class=l>and listening armies catch the godlike fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon round the two ajaxes there gathered strong bands of</p>
    <p class=l>fix’d at his post was each bold ajax found,<br />with well-ranged squadrons strongly circled round:<br />so close their order, so disposed their fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men, of whom not even mars nor minerva, marshaller of hosts could</p>
    <p class=l>as pallas’ self might view with fix’d delight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>make light if they went among them, for they were the picked men</p>
    <p class=l>or had the god of war inclined his eyes,<br />the god of war had own’d a just surprise.<br />a chosen phalanx, firm, resolved as fate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of all those who were now awaiting the onset of hector and the</p>
    <p class=l>descending hector and his battle wait.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>an iron scene gleams dreadful o’er the fields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they made a living fence, spear to spear, shield to</p>
    <p class=l>armour in armour lock’d, and shields in shields,<br />spears lean on spears, on targets targets throng,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shield, buckler to buckler, helmet to helmet, and man to man.</p>
    <p class=l>helms stuck to helms, and man drove man along.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>the floating plumes unnumber’d wave above,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horse-hair crests on their gleaming helmets touched one another</p>
    <p class=l>as when an earthquake stirs the nodding grove;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as they nodded forward, so closely serried were they; the spears</p>
    <p class=l>and levell’d at the skies with pointing rays,<br />their brandish’d lances at each motion blaze.<br />thus breathing death, in terrible array,<br />the close compacted legions urged their way:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they brandished in their strong hands were interlaced, and their</p>
    <p class=l>fierce they drove on, impatient to destroy;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hearts were set on battle.</p>
    <p class=l>troy charged the first, and hector first of troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans advanced in a dense body, with hector at their head</p>
    <p class=l>as from some mountain’s craggy forehead torn,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pressing right on as a rock that comes thundering down the side</p>
    <p class=l>a rock’s round fragment flies, with fury borne,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of some mountain from whose brow the winter torrents have torn</p>
    <p class=l>(which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it; the foundations of the dull thing have been loosened by</p>
    <p class=l>precipitate the ponderous mass descends:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>floods of rain, and as it bounds headlong on its way it sets the</p>
    <p class=l>from steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whole forest in an uproar; it swerves neither to right nor left</p>
    <p class=l>at every shock the crackling wood resounds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>till it reaches level ground, but then for all its fury it can go</p>
    <p class=l>still gathering force, it smokes; and urged amain,<br />whirls, leaps, and thunders down, impetuous to the plain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>no further—even so easily did hector for a while seem as though</p>
    <p class=l>there stops—so hector.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he would career through the tents and ships of the achaeans till</p>
    <p class=l>their whole force he proved,[230]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he had reached the sea in his murderous course; but the closely</p>
    <p class=l>resistless when he raged, and, when he stopp’d, unmoved.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>serried battalions stayed him when he reached them, for the sons</p>
    <p class=l>on him the war is bent, the darts are shed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the achaeans thrust at him with swords and spears pointed at</p>
    <p class=l>and all their falchions wave around his head:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>both ends, and drove him from them so that he staggered and gave</p>
    <p class=l>repulsed he stands, nor from his stand retires;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ground; thereon he shouted to the trojans, “trojans, lycians, and</p>
    <p class=l>but with repeated shouts his army fires.<br />“trojans!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dardanians, fighters in close combat, stand firm: the achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>be firm; this arm shall make your way</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have set themselves as a wall against me, but they will not check</p>
    <p class=l>through yon square body, and that black array:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me for long; they will give ground before me if the mightiest of</p>
    <p class=l>stand, and my spear shall rout their scattering power,<br />strong as they seem, embattled like a tower;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the gods, the thundering spouse of juno, has indeed inspired my</p>
    <p class=l>for he that juno’s heavenly bosom warms,<br />the first of gods, this day inspires our arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>onset.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he put heart and soul into them all.</p>
    <p class=l>he said; and roused the soul in every breast:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deiphobus</p>
    <p class=l>urged with desire of fame, beyond the rest,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of priam went about among them intent on deeds of daring with</p>
    <p class=l>forth march’d deiphobus; but, marching, held</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his round shield before him, under cover of which he strode<br />quickly forward.</p>
    <p class=l>before his wary steps his ample shield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones took aim at him with a spear, nor did</p>
    <p class=l>bold merion aim’d a stroke (nor aim’d it wide);</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he fail to hit the broad orb of ox-hide; but he was far from</p>
    <p class=l>the glittering javelin pierced the tough bull-hide;<br />but pierced not through: unfaithful to his hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>piercing it for the spear broke in two pieces long ere he could</p>
    <p class=l>the point broke short, and sparkled in the sand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do so; moreover deiphobus had seen it coming and had held his</p>
    <p class=l>the trojan warrior, touch’d with timely fear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shield well away from him.<br />meriones drew back under cover of his</p>
    <p class=l>on the raised orb to distance bore the spear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>comrades, angry alike at having failed to vanquish deiphobus, and</p>
    <p class=l>the greek, retreating, mourn’d his frustrate blow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>having broken his spear.</p>
    <p class=l>and cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he turned therefore towards the ships</p>
    <p class=l>then to the ships with surly speed he went,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and tents to fetch a spear which he had left behind in his tent.</p>
    <p class=l>to seek a surer javelin in his tent.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up into</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile with rising rage the battle glows,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the heavens.</p>
    <p class=l>the tumult thickens, and the clamour grows.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>teucer son of telamon was the first to kill his man,</p>
    <p class=l>by teucer’s arm the warlike imbrius bleeds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to wit, the warrior imbrius, son of mentor, rich in horses.</p>
    <p class=l>the son of mentor, rich in generous steeds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>until</p>
    <p class=l>ere yet to troy the sons of greece were led,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans came he had lived in pedaeum, and had married</p>
    <p class=l>in fair pedaeus’ verdant pastures bred,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>medesicaste, a bastard daughter of priam; but on the arrival of</p>
    <p class=l>the youth had dwelt, remote from war’s alarms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the danaan fleet he had gone back to ilius, and was a great man</p>
    <p class=l>and blest in bright medesicaste’s arms:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among the trojans, dwelling near priam himself, who gave him like</p>
    <p class=l>(this nymph, the fruit of priam’s ravish’d joy,<br />allied the warrior to the house of troy:)<br />to troy, when glory call’d his arms, he came,<br />and match’d the bravest of her chiefs in fame:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>honour with his own sons.</p>
    <p class=l>with priam’s sons, a guardian of the throne,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of telamon now struck him under</p>
    <p class=l>he lived, beloved and honour’d as his own.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ear with a spear which he then drew back again, and imbrius</p>
    <p class=l>him teucer pierced between the throat and ear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fell headlong as an ash-tree when it is felled on the crest of</p>
    <p class=l>he groans beneath the telamonian spear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some high mountain beacon, and its delicate green foliage comes</p>
    <p class=l>as from some far-seen mountain’s airy crown,<br />subdued by steel, a tall ash tumbles down,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>toppling down to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>and soils its verdant tresses on the ground;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he fall with his</p>
    <p class=l>so falls the youth; his arms the fall resound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bronze-dight armour ringing harshly round him, and teucer sprang</p>
    <p class=l>then teucer rushing to despoil the dead,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forward with intent to strip him of his armour; but as he was<br />doing so, hector took aim at him with a spear.</p>
    <p class=l>from hector’s hand a shining javelin fled:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>teucer saw the</p>
    <p class=l>he saw, and shunn’d the death; the forceful dart</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear coming and swerved aside, whereon it hit amphimachus, son</p>
    <p class=l>sung on, and pierced amphimachus’s heart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of cteatus son of actor, in the chest as he was coming into</p>
    <p class=l>cteatus’ son, of neptune’s forceful line;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battle, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily</p>
    <p class=l>vain was his courage, and his race divine!<br />prostrate he falls; his clanging arms resound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>and his broad buckler thunders on the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector sprang forward to take amphimachus’s helmet</p>
    <p class=l>to seize his beamy helm the victor flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from off his temples, and in a moment ajax threw a spear at him,</p>
    <p class=l>and just had fastened on the dazzling prize,<br />when ajax’ manly arm a javelin flung;<br />full on the shield’s round boss the weapon rung;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but did not wound him, for he was encased all over in his</p>
    <p class=l>he felt the shock, nor more was doom’d to feel,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>terrible armour; nevertheless the spear struck the boss of his</p>
    <p class=l>secure in mail, and sheath’d in shining steel.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shield with such force as to drive him back from the two corpses,</p>
    <p class=l>repulsed he yields; the victor greeks obtain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which the achaeans then drew off.<br />stichius and menestheus,</p>
    <p class=l>the spoils contested, and bear off the slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>captains of the athenians, bore away amphimachus to the host of</p>
    <p class=l>between the leaders of the athenian line,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans, while the two brave and impetuous ajaxes did the</p>
    <p class=l>(stichius the brave, menestheus the divine,)<br />deplored amphimachus, sad object!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like by imbrius.</p>
    <p class=l>lies;<br />imbrius remains the fierce ajaces’ prize.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as two lions snatch a goat from the hounds that</p>
    <p class=l>as two grim lions bear across the lawn,<br />snatch’d from devouring hounds, a slaughter’d fawn.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have it in their fangs, and bear it through thick brushwood high<br />above the ground in their jaws, thus did the ajaxes bear aloft</p>
    <p class=l>in their fell jaws high-lifting through the wood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the body of imbrius, and strip it of its armour.</p>
    <p class=l>and sprinkling all the shrubs with drops of blood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then the son of</p>
    <p class=l>so these, the chief: great ajax from the dead</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>oileus severed the head from the neck in revenge for the death of</p>
    <p class=l>strips his bright arms; oïleus lops his head:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>amphimachus, and sent it whirling over the crowd as though it had</p>
    <p class=l>toss’d like a ball, and whirl’d in air away,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>been a ball, till it fell in the dust at hector’s feet.</p>
    <p class=l>at hector’s feet the gory visage lay.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neptune was exceedingly angry that his grandson amphimachus</p>
    <p class=l>the god of ocean, fired with stern disdain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should have fallen; he therefore went to the tents and ships of</p>
    <p class=l>and pierced with sorrow for his grandson slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans to urge the danaans still further, and to devise</p>
    <p class=l>inspires the grecian hearts, confirms their hands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>evil for the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>and breathes destruction on the trojan bands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus met him, as he was taking leave</p>
    <p class=l>swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet,<br />he finds the lance-famed idomen of crete,<br />his pensive brow the generous care express’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of a comrade, who had just come to him from the fight, wounded in</p>
    <p class=l>with which a wounded soldier touch’d his breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the knee.</p>
    <p class=l>whom in the chance of war a javelin tore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his fellow-soldiers bore him off the field, and</p>
    <p class=l>and his sad comrades from the battle bore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus having given orders to the physicians went on to his</p>
    <p class=l>him to the surgeons of the camp he sent:<br />that office paid, he issued from his tent</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tent, for he was still thirsting for battle.</p>
    <p class=l>fierce for the fight: to whom the god begun,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neptune spoke in the<br />likeness and with the voice of thoas son of andraemon who ruled</p>
    <p class=l>in thoas’ voice, andræmon’s valiant son,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the aetolians of all pleuron and high calydon, and was honoured</p>
    <p class=l>who ruled where calydon’s white rocks arise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among his people as though he were a god.</p>
    <p class=l>and pleuron’s chalky cliffs emblaze the skies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“idomeneus,” said he,<br />“lawgiver to the cretans, what has now become of the threats with</p>
    <p class=l>“where’s now the imperious vaunt, the daring boast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which the sons of the achaeans used to threaten the trojans?</p>
    <p class=l>of greece victorious, and proud ilion lost?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and idomeneus chief among the cretans answered, “thoas, no one,</p>
    <p class=l>to whom the king: “on greece no blame be thrown;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so far as i know, is in fault, for we can all fight.</p>
    <p class=l>arms are her trade, and war is all her own.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>none are</p>
    <p class=l>her hardy heroes from the well-fought plains</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>held back neither by fear nor slackness, but it seems to be the</p>
    <p class=l>nor fear withholds, nor shameful sloth detains:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will of almighty jove that the achaeans should perish</p>
    <p class=l>’tis heaven, alas!<br />and jove’s all-powerful doom,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ingloriously here far from argos: you, thoas, have been always</p>
    <p class=l>that far, far distant from our native home<br />wills us to fall inglorious!<br />oh, my friend!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>staunch, and you keep others in heart if you see any fail in</p>
    <p class=l>once foremost in the fight, still prone to lend</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>duty; be not then remiss now, but exhort all to do their utmost.</p>
    <p class=l>or arms or counsels, now perform thy best,<br />and what thou canst not singly, urge the rest.</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to this neptune lord of the earthquake made answer, “idomeneus,</p>
    <p class=l>thus he: and thus the god whose force can make<br />the solid globe’s eternal basis shake:<br />“ah!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may he never return from troy, but remain here for dogs to batten</p>
    <p class=l>never may he see his native land,<br />but feed the vultures on this hateful strand,<br />who seeks ignobly in his ships to stay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon, who is this day wilfully slack in fighting.</p>
    <p class=l>nor dares to combat on this signal day!</p>

    <p class=l>for this, behold!<br />in horrid arms i shine,</p>

    <p class=r>though we are only two.</p>
    <p class=l>two, not the worst; nor even this succour vain:</p>

    <p class=l>not vain the weakest, if their force unite;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>companionship, and we two can hold our own with the bravest.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therewith the god went back into the thick of the fight, and</p>
    <p class=l>this said, he rushes where the combat burns;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus when he had reached his tent donned his armour, grasped</p>
    <p class=l>swift to his tent the cretan king returns:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his two spears, and sallied forth.</p>
    <p class=l>from thence, two javelins glittering in his hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as the lightning which the son</p>
    <p class=l>and clad in arms that lighten’d all the strand,<br />fierce on the foe the impetuous hero drove,<br />like lightning bursting from the arm of jove,<br />which to pale man the wrath of heaven declares,<br />or terrifies the offending world with wars;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of saturn brandishes from bright olympus when he would show a</p>
    <p class=l>in streamy sparkles, kindling all the skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sign to mortals, and its gleam flashes far and wide—even so did</p>
    <p class=l>from pole to pole the trail of glory flies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his armour gleam about him as he ran.</p>
    <p class=l>thus his bright armour o’er the dazzled throng</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones his sturdy squire</p>
    <p class=l>gleam’d dreadful, as the monarch flash’d along.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>met him while he was still near his tent (for he was going to</p>
    <p class=l>him, near his tent, meriones attends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fetch his spear) and idomeneus said:</p>
    <p class=l>whom thus he questions: “ever best of friends!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“meriones, fleet son of molus, best of comrades, why have you</p>
    <p class=l>o say, in every art of battle skill’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>left the field?</p>
    <p class=l>what holds thy courage from so brave a field?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are you wounded, and is the point of the weapon</p>
    <p class=l>on some important message art thou bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hurting you?<br />or have you been sent to fetch me?</p>
    <p class=l>or bleeds my friend by some unhappy wound?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i want no</p>
    <p class=l>inglorious here, my soul abhors to stay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fetching; i had far rather fight than stay in my tent.</p>
    <p class=l>and glows with prospects of th’ approaching day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”<br />“o prince!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“idomeneus,” answered meriones, “i come for a spear, if i can</p>
    <p class=l>(meriones replies) whose care<br />leads forth the embattled sons of crete to war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>find one in my tent; i have broken the one i had, in throwing it</p>
    <p class=l>this speaks my grief: this headless lance i wield;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at the shield of deiphobus.</p>
    <p class=l>the rest lies rooted in a trojan shield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and idomeneus captain of the cretans answered, “you will find one</p>
    <p class=l>to whom the cretan: “enter, and receive</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear, or twenty if you so please, standing up against the end</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wall of my tent.</p>
    <p class=l>that shed a lustre round the illumined wall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have taken them from trojans whom i have</p>
    <p class=l>though i, disdainful of the distant war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>killed, for i am not one to keep my enemy at arm’s length;</p>
    <p class=l>nor trust the dart, nor aim the uncertain spear,<br />yet hand to hand i fight, and spoil the slain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore i have spears, bossed shields, helmets, and burnished</p>
    <p class=l>and thence these trophies, and these arms i gain.<br />enter, and see on heaps the helmets roll’d,<br />and high-hung spears, and shields that flame with gold.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>corslets.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then meriones said, “i too in my tent and at my ship have spoils</p>
    <p class=l>“nor vain (said merion) are our martial toils;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>taken from the trojans, but they are not at hand.</p>
    <p class=l>we too can boast of no ignoble spoils:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have been at</p>
    <p class=l>but those my ship contains; whence distant far,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all times valorous, and wherever there has been hard fighting</p>
    <p class=l>i fight conspicuous in the van of war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have held my own among the foremost.</p>
    <p class=l>what need i more?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there may be those among the</p>
    <p class=l>if any greek there be</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans who do not know how i fight, but you know it well enough</p>
    <p class=l>who knows not merion, i appeal to thee.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yourself.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus answered, “i know you for a brave man: you need not</p>
    <p class=l>to this, idomeneus: “the fields of fight</p>

    <p class=r>if the best men at the ships were being chosen to go on</p>
    <p class=l>and were some ambush for the foes design’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>an ambush—and there is nothing like this for showing what a man</p>
    <p class=l>even there thy courage would not lag behind:<br />in that sharp service, singled from the rest,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is made of; it comes out then who is cowardly and who brave; the</p>
    <p class=l>the fear of each, or valour, stands confess’d.<br />no force, no firmness, the pale coward shows;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>coward will change colour at every touch and turn; he is full of</p>
    <p class=l>he shifts his place: his colour comes and goes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fears, and keeps shifting his weight first on one knee and then</p>
    <p class=l>a dropping sweat creeps cold on every part;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on the other; his heart beats fast as he thinks of death, and one</p>
    <p class=l>against his bosom beats his quivering heart;<br />terror and death in his wild eye-balls stare;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can hear the chattering of his teeth; whereas the brave man will</p>
    <p class=l>with chattering teeth he stands, and stiffening hair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not change colour nor be frightened on finding himself in ambush,</p>
    <p class=l>and looks a bloodless image of despair!<br />not so the brave—still dauntless, still the same,<br />unchanged his colour, and unmoved his frame:<br />composed his thought, determined is his eye,<br />and fix’d his soul, to conquer or to die:<br />if aught disturb the tenour of his breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but is all the time longing to go into action—if the best men</p>
    <p class=l>’tis but the wish to strike before the rest.</p>

    <p class=r>if you were struck by a dart or</p>
    <p class=l>by chance of fight whatever wounds you bore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>smitten in close combat, it would not be from behind, in your</p>

    <p class=l>such as may teach, ’twas still thy brave delight</p>

    <p class=r>as you were pressing forward to a place in the front ranks.</p>

    <p class=r>but</p>
    <p class=l>but why, like infants, cold to honour’s charms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us no longer stay here talking like children, lest we be ill</p>
    <p class=l>stand we to talk, when glory calls to arms?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spoken of; go, fetch your spear from the tent at once.</p>
    <p class=l>go—from my conquer’d spears the choicest take,<br />and to their owners send them nobly back.</p>

    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this meriones, peer of mars, went to the tent and got himself</p>
    <p class=l>swift at the word bold merion snatch’d a spear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a spear of bronze.</p>
    <p class=l>and, breathing slaughter, follow’d to the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then followed after idomeneus, big with</p>
    <p class=l>so mars armipotent invades the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great deeds of valour.<br />as when baneful mars sallies forth to</p>
    <p class=l>(the wide destroyer of the race of man,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battle, and his son panic so strong and dauntless goes with him,</p>
    <p class=l>terror, his best-beloved son, attends his course,<br />arm’d with stern boldness, and enormous force;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to strike terror even into the heart of a hero—the pair have gone</p>
    <p class=l>the pride of haughty warriors to confound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from thrace to arm themselves among the ephyri or the brave</p>
    <p class=l>and lay the strength of tyrants on the ground:<br />from thrace they fly, call’d to the dire alarms<br />of warring phlegyans, and ephyrian arms;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>phlegyans, but they will not listen to both the contending hosts,</p>
    <p class=l>invoked by both, relentless they dispose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and will give victory to one side or to the other—even so did</p>
    <p class=l>to these glad conquest, murderous rout to those.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones and idomeneus, captains of men, go out to battle clad in</p>
    <p class=l>so march’d the leaders of the cretan train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their bronze armour.</p>
    <p class=l>and their bright arms shot horror o’er the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones was first to speak.<br />“son of</p>
    <p class=l>then first spake merion: “shall we join the right,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deucalion,” said he, “where would you have us begin fighting?<br />on</p>
    <p class=l>or combat in the centre of the fight?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the right wing of the host, in the centre, or on the left wing,</p>
    <p class=l>or to the left our wonted succour lend?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>where i take it the achaeans will be weakest?</p>
    <p class=l>hazard and fame all parts alike attend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus answered, “there are others to defend the centre—the</p>
    <p class=l>“not in the centre (idomen replied:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two ajaxes and teucer, who is the finest archer of all the</p>
    <p class=l>our ablest chieftains the main battle guide;<br />each godlike ajax makes that post his care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans, and is good also in a hand-to-hand fight.</p>
    <p class=l>and gallant teucer deals destruction there,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these will</p>
    <p class=l>skill’d or with shafts to gall the distant field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>give hector son of priam enough to do; fight as he may, he will</p>
    <p class=l>or bear close battle on the sounding shield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>find it hard to vanquish their indomitable fury, and fire the</p>
    <p class=l>these can the rage of haughty hector tame:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships, unless the son of saturn fling a firebrand upon them with</p>
    <p class=l>safe in their arms, the navy fears no flame,<br />till jove himself descends, his bolts to shed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his own hand.</p>
    <p class=l>and hurl the blazing ruin at our head.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great ajax son of telamon will yield to no man who</p>
    <p class=l>great must he be, of more than human birth,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is in mortal mould and eats the grain of ceres, if bronze and</p>
    <p class=l>nor feed like mortals on the fruits of earth.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great stones can overthrow him.</p>
    <p class=l>him neither rocks can crush, nor steel can wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he would not yield even to</p>
    <p class=l>whom ajax fells not on the ensanguined ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles in hand-to-hand fight, and in fleetness of foot there is</p>
    <p class=l>in standing fight he mates achilles’ force,<br />excell’d alone in swiftness in the course.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>none to beat him; let us turn therefore towards the left wing,</p>
    <p class=l>then to the left our ready arms apply,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that we may know forthwith whether we are to give glory to some<br />other, or he to us.</p>
    <p class=l>and live with glory, or with glory die.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones, peer of fleet mars, then led the way till they came to</p>
    <p class=l>he said: and merion to th’ appointed place,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the part of the host which idomeneus had named.</p>
    <p class=l>fierce as the god of battles, urged his pace.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now when the trojans saw idomeneus coming on like a flame of</p>
    <p class=l>soon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fire, him and his squire clad in their richly wrought armour,</p>
    <p class=l>rush like a fiery torrent o’er the field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they shouted and made towards him all in a body, and a furious</p>
    <p class=l>their force embodied in a tide they pour;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hand-to-hand fight raged under the ships’ sterns.</p>
    <p class=l>the rising combat sounds along the shore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fierce as the</p>
    <p class=l>as warring winds, in sirius’ sultry reign,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shrill winds that whistle upon a day when dust lies deep on the</p>
    <p class=l>from different quarters sweep the sandy plain;<br />on every side the dusty whirlwinds rise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>roads, and the gusts raise it into a thick cloud—even such was</p>
    <p class=l>and the dry fields are lifted to the skies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fury of the combat, and might and main did they hack at each</p>
    <p class=l>thus by despair, hope, rage, together driven,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>other with spear and sword throughout the host.</p>
    <p class=l>met the black hosts, and, meeting, darken’d heaven.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the field</p>
    <p class=l>all dreadful glared the iron face of war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bristled with the long and deadly spears which they bore.</p>
    <p class=l>bristled with upright spears, that flash’d afar;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dazzling was the sheen of their gleaming helmets, their</p>
    <p class=l>dire was the gleam of breastplates, helms, and shields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fresh-burnished breastplates, and glittering shields as they</p>
    <p class=l>and polish’d arms emblazed the flaming fields:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>joined battle with one another.</p>
    <p class=l>tremendous scene!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>iron indeed must be his courage</p>
    <p class=l>that general horror gave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who could take pleasure in the sight of such a turmoil, and look<br />on it without being dismayed.</p>
    <p class=l>but touch’d with joy the bosoms of the brave.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did the two mighty sons of saturn devise evil for mortal</p>
    <p class=l>saturn’s great sons in fierce contention vied,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heroes.</p>
    <p class=l>and crowds of heroes in their anger died.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove was minded to give victory to the trojans and to</p>
    <p class=l>the sire of earth and heaven, by thetis won</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector, so as to do honour to fleet achilles, nevertheless he did</p>
    <p class=l>to crown with glory peleus’ godlike son,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not mean to utterly overthrow the achaean host before ilius, and</p>
    <p class=l>will’d not destruction to the grecian powers,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>only wanted to glorify thetis and her valiant son.</p>
    <p class=l>but spared awhile the destined trojan towers;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neptune on the<br />other hand went about among the argives to incite them, having</p>
    <p class=l>while neptune, rising from his azure main,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come up from the grey sea in secret, for he was grieved at seeing</p>
    <p class=l>warr’d on the king of heaven with stern disdain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them vanquished by the trojans, and was furiously angry with</p>
    <p class=l>and breathed revenge, and fired the grecian train.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove.</p>
    <p class=l>gods of one source, of one ethereal race,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>both were of the same race and country, but jove was elder</p>
    <p class=l>alike divine, and heaven their native place;<br />but jove the greater; first-born of the skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>born and knew more, therefore neptune feared to defend the</p>
    <p class=l>and more than men, or gods, supremely wise.<br />for this, of jove’s superior might afraid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>argives openly, but in the likeness of man, he kept on<br />encouraging them throughout their host.</p>
    <p class=l>neptune in human form conceal’d his aid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus, then, did these two</p>
    <p class=l>these powers enfold the greek and trojan train</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>devise a knot of war and battle, that none could unloose or</p>
    <p class=l>in war and discord’s adamantine chain,<br />indissolubly strong: the fatal tie</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>break, and set both sides tugging at it, to the failing of men’s<br />knees beneath them.</p>
    <p class=l>is stretch’d on both, and close compell’d they die.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with grey,<br />called loud on the danaans and spread panic among the trojans as</p>
    <p class=l>dreadful in arms, and grown in combats grey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he leaped in among them.</p>
    <p class=l>the bold idomeneus controls the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he slew othryoneus from cabesus, a</p>
    <p class=l>first by his hand othryoneus was slain,<br />swell’d with false hopes, with mad ambition vain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sojourner, who had but lately come to take part in the war.</p>
    <p class=l>call’d by the voice of war to martial fame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>from high cabesus’ distant walls he came;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sought cassandra, the fairest of priam’s daughters, in marriage,</p>
    <p class=l>cassandra’s love he sought, with boasts of power,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but offered no gifts of wooing, for he promised a great thing, to</p>
    <p class=l>and promised conquest was the proffer’d dower.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wit, that he would drive the sons of the achaeans willy nilly</p>
    <p class=l>the king consented, by his vaunts abused;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from troy; old king priam had given his consent and promised her</p>
    <p class=l>the king consented, but the fates refused.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to him, whereon he fought on the strength of the promises thus</p>
    <p class=l>proud of himself, and of the imagined bride,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>made to him.</p>
    <p class=l>the field he measured with a larger stride.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus aimed a spear, and hit him as he came</p>
    <p class=l>him as he stalk’d, the cretan javelin found;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>striding on.</p>
    <p class=l>vain was his breastplate to repel the wound:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his cuirass of bronze did not protect him, and the</p>
    <p class=l>his dream of glory lost, he plunged to hell;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear stuck in his belly, so that he fell heavily to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>his arms resounded as the boaster fell.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then idomeneus vaunted over him saying, “othryoneus, there is no</p>
    <p class=l>the great idomeneus bestrides the dead;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one in the world whom i shall admire more than i do you, if you</p>
    <p class=l>“and thus (he cries) behold thy promise sped!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>indeed perform what you have promised priam son of dardanus in</p>
    <p class=l>such is the help thy arms to ilion bring,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>return for his daughter.</p>
    <p class=l>and such the contract of the phrygian king!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we too will make you an offer; we will</p>
    <p class=l>our offers now, illustrious prince!</p>

    <p class=l>receive;</p>

    <p class=r>bring her from argos for you to marry, if you will sack the</p>
    <p class=l>for such an aid what will not argos give?<br />to conquer troy, with ours thy forces join,<br />and count atrides’ fairest daughter thine.</p>

    <p class=r>goodly city of ilius in company with ourselves; so come along</p>
    <p class=l>meantime, on further methods to advise,</p>

    <p class=r>with me, that we may make a covenant at the ships about the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>marriage, and we will not be hard upon you about gifts of</p>
    <p class=l>there hear what greece has on her part to say.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wooing.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, and dragg’d the gory corse away.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thick of the fight, but asius came up to protect the body, on</p>
    <p class=l>this asius view’d, unable to contain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foot, in front of his horses which his esquire drove so close</p>
    <p class=l>before his chariot warring on the plain:<br />(his crowded coursers, to his squire consign’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>behind him that he could feel their breath upon his shoulder.</p>
    <p class=l>impatient panted on his neck behind:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>to vengeance rising with a sudden spring,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was longing to strike down idomeneus, but ere he could do so</p>
    <p class=l>he hoped the conquest of the cretan king.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus smote him with his spear in the throat under the chin,</p>
    <p class=l>the wary cretan, as his foe drew near,<br />full on his throat discharged the forceful spear:<br />beneath the chin the point was seen to glide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and the bronze point went clean through it.</p>
    <p class=l>and glitter’d, extant at the further side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he fell as an oak, or</p>
    <p class=l>as when the mountain-oak, or poplar tall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>poplar, or pine which shipwrights have felled for ship’s timber</p>
    <p class=l>or pine, fit mast for some great admiral,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon the mountains with whetted axes—even thus did he lie full</p>
    <p class=l>groans to the oft-heaved axe, with many a wound,<br />then spreads a length of ruin o’er the ground:<br />so sunk proud asius in that dreadful day,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>length in front of his chariot and horses, grinding his teeth and</p>
    <p class=l>and stretch’d before his much-loved coursers lay.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>clutching at the blood-stained dust.</p>
    <p class=l>he grinds the dust distain’d with streaming gore,<br />and, fierce in death, lies foaming on the shore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his charioteer was struck</p>
    <p class=l>deprived of motion, stiff with stupid fear,<br />stands all aghast his trembling charioteer,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with panic and did not dare turn his horses round and escape:</p>
    <p class=l>nor shuns the foe, nor turns the steeds away,<br />but falls transfix’d, an unresisting prey:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereupon antilochus hit him in the middle of his body with a<br />spear; his cuirass of bronze did not protect him, and the spear<br />stuck in his belly.</p>
    <p class=l>pierced by antilochus, he pants beneath</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he fell gasping from his chariot and</p>
    <p class=l>the stately car, and labours out his breath.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>antilochus, great nestor’s son, drove his horses from the trojans</p>
    <p class=l>thus asius’ steeds (their mighty master gone)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>remain the prize of nestor’s youthful son.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deiphobus then came close up to idomeneus to avenge asius, and</p>
    <p class=l>stabb’d at the sight, deiphobus drew nigh,<br />and made, with force, the vengeful weapon fly.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>took aim at him with a spear, but idomeneus was on the look-out</p>
    <p class=l>the cretan saw; and, stooping, caused to glance</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and avoided it, for he was covered by the round shield he always</p>
    <p class=l>from his slope shield the disappointed lance.<br />beneath the spacious targe, (a blazing round,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bore—a shield of ox-hide and bronze with two arm-rods on the</p>
    <p class=l>thick with bull-hides and brazen orbits bound,<br />on his raised arm by two strong braces stay’d,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>inside.</p>
    <p class=l>he lay collected in defensive shade.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he crouched under cover of this, and the spear flew over</p>
    <p class=l>o’er his safe head the javelin idly sung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him, but the shield rang out as the spear grazed it, and the</p>
    <p class=l>and on the tinkling verge more faintly rung.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>weapon sped not in vain from the strong hand of deiphobus, for it</p>
    <p class=l>even then the spear the vigorous arm confess’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>struck hypsenor son of hippasus, shepherd of his people, in the</p>
    <p class=l>and pierced, obliquely, king hypsenor’s breast:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>liver under the midriff, and his limbs failed beneath him.</p>
    <p class=l>warm’d in his liver, to the ground it bore</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deiphobus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying,</p>
    <p class=l>the chief, his people’s guardian now no more!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“of a truth asius has not fallen unavenged; he will be glad even</p>
    <p class=l>“not unattended (the proud trojan cries)<br />nor unrevenged, lamented asius lies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while passing into the house of hades, strong warden of the gate,</p>
    <p class=l>for thee, through hell’s black portals stand display’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that i have sent some one to escort him.</p>
    <p class=l>this mate shall joy thy melancholy shade.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he vaunt, and the argives were stung by his saying.</p>
    <p class=l>heart-piercing anguish, at the haughty boast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>noble antilochus was more angry than any one, but grief did not</p>
    <p class=l>touch’d every greek, but nestor’s son the most.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>make him forget his friend and comrade.<br />he ran up to him,</p>
    <p class=l>grieved as he was, his pious arms attend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bestrode him, and covered him with his shield; then two of his</p>
    <p class=l>and his broad buckler shields his slaughter’d friend:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>staunch comrades, mecisteus son of echius, and alastor, stooped</p>
    <p class=l>till sad mecistheus and alastor bore</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>down, and bore him away groaning heavily to the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>his honour’d body to the tented shore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but<br />idomeneus ceased not his fury.</p>
    <p class=l>nor yet from fight idomeneus withdraws;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he kept on striving continually</p>
    <p class=l>resolved to perish in his country’s cause,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>either to enshroud some trojan in the darkness of death, or</p>
    <p class=l>or find some foe, whom heaven and he shall doom<br />to wail his fate in death’s eternal gloom.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>himself to fall while warding off the evil day from the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>he sees alcathous in the front aspire:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then fell alcathous son of noble aesyetes; he was son-in-law to</p>
    <p class=l>great æsyetes was the hero’s sire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>anchises, having married his eldest daughter hippodameia, who was</p>
    <p class=l>his spouse hippodame, divinely fair,<br />anchises’ eldest hope, and darling care:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the darling of her father and mother, and excelled all her</p>
    <p class=l>who charm’d her parents’ and her husband’s heart</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>generation in beauty, accomplishments, and understanding,</p>
    <p class=l>with beauty, sense, and every work of art:<br />he once of ilion’s youth the loveliest boy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wherefore the bravest man in all troy had taken her to wife—him</p>
    <p class=l>the fairest she of all the fair of troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did neptune lay low by the hand of idomeneus, blinding his bright</p>
    <p class=l>by neptune now the hapless hero dies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eyes and binding his strong limbs in fetters so that he could</p>
    <p class=l>who covers with a cloud those beauteous eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neither go back nor to one side, but stood stock still like</p>
    <p class=l>and fetters every limb: yet bent to meet</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pillar or lofty tree when idomeneus struck him with a spear in</p>
    <p class=l>his fate he stands; nor shuns the lance of crete.<br />fix’d as some column, or deep-rooted oak,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the middle of his chest.</p>
    <p class=l>while the winds sleep; his breast received the stroke.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the coat of mail that had hitherto</p>
    <p class=l>before the ponderous stroke his corslet yields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>protected his body was now broken, and rang harshly as the spear</p>
    <p class=l>long used to ward the death in fighting fields.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tore through it.</p>
    <p class=l>the riven armour sends a jarring sound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he fell heavily to the ground, and the spear</p>
    <p class=l>his labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound,<br />the long lance shakes, and vibrates in the wound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stuck in his heart, which still beat, and made the butt-end of</p>
    <p class=l>fast flowing from its source, as prone he lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the spear quiver till dread mars put an end to his life.</p>
    <p class=l>life’s purple tide impetuous gush’d away.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying,</p>
    <p class=l>then idomen, insulting o’er the slain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“deiphobus, since you are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits</p>
    <p class=l>“behold, deiphobus!<br />nor vaunt in vain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now that we have killed three men to your one?</p>
    <p class=l>see!<br />on one greek three trojan ghosts attend;<br />this, my third victim, to the shades i send.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nay, sir, stand in<br />fight with me yourself, that you may learn what manner of</p>
    <p class=l>approaching now thy boasted might approve,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove-begotten man am i that have come hither.</p>
    <p class=l>and try the prowess of the seed of jove.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove first begot</p>
    <p class=l>from jove, enamour’d of a mortal dame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minos, chief ruler in crete, and minos in his turn begot a son,</p>
    <p class=l>great minos, guardian of his country, came:<br />deucalion, blameless prince, was minos’ heir;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>noble deucalion.</p>
    <p class=l>his first-born i, the third from jupiter:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deucalion begot me to be a ruler over many men</p>
    <p class=l>o’er spacious crete, and her bold sons, i reign,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in crete, and my ships have now brought me hither, to be the bane</p>
    <p class=l>and thence my ships transport me through the main:<br />lord of a host, o’er all my host i shine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of yourself, your father, and the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>a scourge to thee, thy father, and thy line.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he speak, and deiphobus was in two minds, whether to go</p>
    <p class=l>the trojan heard; uncertain or to meet,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>back and fetch some other trojan to help him, or to take up the</p>
    <p class=l>alone, with venturous arms the king of crete,<br />or seek auxiliar force; at length decreed</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>challenge single-handed.</p>
    <p class=l>to call some hero to partake the deed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the end, he deemed it best to go and</p>
    <p class=l>forthwith æneas rises to his thought:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fetch aeneas, whom he found standing in the rear, for he had long</p>
    <p class=l>for him in troy’s remotest lines he sought,<br />where he, incensed at partial priam, stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>been aggrieved with priam because in spite of his brave deeds he</p>
    <p class=l>and sees superior posts in meaner hands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did not give him his due share of honour.</p>
    <p class=l>to him, ambitious of so great an aid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deiphobus went up to</p>
    <p class=l>the bold deiphobus approach’d, and said:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him and said, “aeneas, prince among the trojans, if you know any</p>
    <p class=l>“now, trojan prince, employ thy pious arms,<br />if e’er thy bosom felt fair honour’s charms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ties of kinship, help me now to defend the body of your sister’s</p>
    <p class=l>alcathous dies, thy brother and thy friend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>husband; come with me to the rescue of alcathous, who being</p>
    <p class=l>come, and the warrior’s loved remains defend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>husband to your sister brought you up when you were a child in</p>
    <p class=l>beneath his cares thy early youth was train’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his house, and now idomeneus has slain him.</p>
    <p class=l>one table fed you, and one roof contain’d.<br />this deed to fierce idomeneus we owe;<br />haste, and revenge it on th’ insulting foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he moved the heart of aeneas, and he went in</p>
    <p class=l>æneas heard, and for a space resign’d<br />to tender pity all his manly mind;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pursuit of idomeneus, big with great deeds of valour; but</p>
    <p class=l>then rising in his rage, he burns to fight:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus was not to be thus daunted as though he were a mere</p>
    <p class=l>the greek awaits him with collected might.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>child; he held his ground as a wild boar at bay upon the</p>
    <p class=l>as the fell boar, on some rough mountain’s head,<br />arm’d with wild terrors, and to slaughter bred,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mountains, who abides the coming of a great crowd of men in some</p>
    <p class=l>when the loud rustics rise, and shout from far,<br />attends the tumult, and expects the war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lonely place—the bristles stand upright on his back, his eyes</p>
    <p class=l>o’er his bent back the bristly horrors rise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flash fire, and he whets his tusks in his eagerness to defend</p>
    <p class=l>fires stream in lightning from his sanguine eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>himself against hounds and men—even so did famed idomeneus hold<br />his ground and budge not at the coming of aeneas.</p>
    <p class=l>his foaming tusks both dogs and men engage;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he cried aloud</p>
    <p class=l>but most his hunters rouse his mighty rage:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to his comrades looking towards ascalaphus, aphareus, deipyrus,</p>
    <p class=l>so stood idomeneus, his javelin shook,<br />and met the trojan with a lowering look.<br />antilochus, deipyrus, were near,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones, and antilochus, all of them brave soldiers—“hither my</p>
    <p class=l>the youthful offspring of the god of war,<br />merion, and aphareus, in field renown’d:<br />to these the warrior sent his voice around.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>friends,” he cried, “and leave me not single-handed—i go in great</p>
    <p class=l>“fellows in arms!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fear by fleet aeneas, who is coming against me, and is a</p>
    <p class=l>your timely aid unite;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>redoubtable dispenser of death battle.</p>
    <p class=l>lo, great æneas rushes to the fight:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moreover he is in the</p>
    <p class=l>sprung from a god, and more than mortal bold;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flower of youth when a man’s strength is greatest; if i was of<br />the same age as he is and in my present mind, either he or i</p>
    <p class=l>he fresh in youth, and i in arms grown old.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should soon bear away the prize of victory.</p>
    <p class=l>else should this hand, this hour decide the strife,<br />the great dispute, of glory, or of life.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this, all of them as one man stood near him, shield on</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, and all, as with one soul, obey’d;<br />their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shoulder.</p>
    <p class=l>around the chief.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas on the other side called to his comrades,</p>
    <p class=l>æneas too demands<br />th’ assisting forces of his native bands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>looking towards deiphobus, paris, and agenor, who were leaders of</p>
    <p class=l>paris, deiphobus, agenor, join;<br />(co-aids and captains of the trojan line;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans along with himself, and the people followed them as</p>
    <p class=l>in order follow all th’ embodied train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sheep follow the ram when they go down to drink after they have</p>
    <p class=l>like ida’s flocks proceeding o’er the plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>been feeding, and the heart of the shepherd is glad—even so was</p>
    <p class=l>before his fleecy care, erect and bold,<br />stalks the proud ram, the father of the bold.<br />with joy the swain surveys them, as he leads<br />to the cool fountains, through the well-known meads:<br />so joys æneas, as his native band</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the heart of aeneas gladdened when he saw his people follow him.</p>
    <p class=l>moves on in rank, and stretches o’er the land.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then they fought furiously in close combat about the body of</p>
    <p class=l>round dread alcathous now the battle rose;<br />on every side the steely circle grows;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alcathous, wielding their long spears; and the bronze armour</p>
    <p class=l>now batter’d breast-plates and hack’d helmets ring,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about their bodies rang fearfully as they took aim at one another</p>
    <p class=l>and o’er their heads unheeded javelins sing.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the press of the fight, while the two heroes aeneas and</p>
    <p class=l>above the rest, two towering chiefs appear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus, peers of mars, outvied everyone in their desire to</p>
    <p class=l>there great idomeneus, æneas here.<br />like gods of war, dispensing fate, they stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hack at each other with sword and spear.</p>
    <p class=l>and burn’d to drench the ground with mutual blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas took aim first,</p>
    <p class=l>the trojan weapon whizz’d along in air;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but idomeneus was on the look-out and avoided the spear, so that</p>
    <p class=l>the cretan saw, and shunn’d the brazen spear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it sped from aeneas’ strong hand in vain, and fell quivering in</p>
    <p class=l>sent from an arm so strong, the missive wood</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>stuck deep in earth, and quiver’d where it stood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus meanwhile smote oenomaus in the middle of</p>
    <p class=l>but oenomas received the cretan’s stroke;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his belly, and broke the plate of his corslet, whereon his bowels</p>
    <p class=l>the forceful spear his hollow corslet broke,<br />it ripp’d his belly with a ghastly wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came gushing out and he clutched the earth in the palms of his</p>
    <p class=l>and roll’d the smoking entrails on the ground.<br />stretch’d on the plain, he sobs away his breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hands as he fell sprawling in the dust.</p>
    <p class=l>and, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus drew his spear</p>
    <p class=l>the victor from his breast the weapon tears;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>out of the body, but could not strip him of the rest of his<br />armour for the rain of darts that were showered upon him:</p>
    <p class=l>his spoils he could not, for the shower of spears.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moreover his strength was now beginning to fail him so that he</p>
    <p class=l>though now unfit an active war to wage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>could no longer charge, and could neither spring forward to</p>
    <p class=l>heavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>recover his own weapon nor swerve aside to avoid one that was</p>
    <p class=l>his listless limbs unable for the course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aimed at him; therefore, though he still defended himself in<br />hand-to-hand fight, his heavy feet could not bear him swiftly out<br />of the battle.</p>
    <p class=l>in standing fight he yet maintains his force;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deiphobus aimed a spear at him as he was</p>
    <p class=l>till faint with labour, and by foes repell’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>retreating slowly from the field, for his bitterness against him</p>
    <p class=l>his tired slow steps he drags from off the field.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was as fierce as ever, but again he missed him, and hit</p>
    <p class=l>deiphobus beheld him as he pass’d,<br />and, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast:<br />the javelin err’d, but held its course along,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ascalaphus, the son of mars; the spear went through his shoulder,</p>
    <p class=l>and pierced ascalaphus, the brave and young:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and he clutched the earth in the palms of his hands as he fell</p>
    <p class=l>the son of mars fell gasping on the ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sprawling in the dust.</p>
    <p class=l>and gnash’d the dust, all bloody with his wound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grim mars of awful voice did not yet know that his son had</p>
    <p class=l>nor knew the furious father of his fall;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fallen, for he was sitting on the summits of olympus under the</p>
    <p class=l>high-throned amidst the great olympian hall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>golden clouds, by command of jove, where the other gods were also</p>
    <p class=l>on golden clouds th’ immortal synod sate;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sitting, forbidden to take part in the battle.</p>
    <p class=l>detain’d from bloody war by jove and fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile men</p>
    <p class=l>now, where in dust the breathless hero lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fought furiously about the body.</p>
    <p class=l>for slain ascalaphus commenced the fray,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deiphobus tore the helmet from</p>
    <p class=l>deiphobus to seize his helmet flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>off his head, but meriones sprang upon him, and struck him on the</p>
    <p class=l>and from his temples rends the glittering prize;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>arm with a spear so that the visored helmet fell from his hand</p>
    <p class=l>valiant as mars, meriones drew near,<br />and on his loaded arm discharged his spear:<br />he drops the weight, disabled with the pain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and came ringing down upon the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>the hollow helmet rings against the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon meriones sprang</p>
    <p class=l>swift as a vulture leaping on his prey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon him like a vulture, drew the spear from his shoulder, and</p>
    <p class=l>from his torn arm the grecian rent away</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fell back under cover of his men.</p>
    <p class=l>the reeking javelin, and rejoin’d his friends.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then polites, own brother of</p>
    <p class=l>his wounded brother good polites tends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deiphobus passed his arms around his waist, and bore him away</p>
    <p class=l>around his waist his pious arms he threw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from the battle till he got to his horses that were standing in</p>
    <p class=l>and from the rage of battle gently drew:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the rear of the fight with the chariot and their driver.</p>
    <p class=l>him his swift coursers, on his splendid car,<br />rapt from the lessening thunder of the war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these</p>
    <p class=l>to troy they drove him, groaning from the shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>took him towards the city groaning and in great pain, with the</p>
    <p class=l>and sprinkling, as he pass’d, the sands with gore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>blood flowing from his arm.</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to heaven<br />without ceasing.</p>
    <p class=l>heaps fall on heaps, and heaven and earth resound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas sprang on aphareus son of caletor, and</p>
    <p class=l>bold aphareus by great æneas bled;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>struck him with a spear in his throat which was turned towards</p>
    <p class=l>as toward the chief he turn’d his daring head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him; his head fell on one side, his helmet and shield came down</p>
    <p class=l>he pierced his throat; the bending head, depress’d<br />beneath his helmet, nods upon his breast;<br />his shield reversed o’er the fallen warrior lies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>along with him, and death, life’s foe, was shed around him.</p>
    <p class=l>and everlasting slumber seals his eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>antilochus spied his chance, flew forward towards thoon, and</p>
    <p class=l>antilochus, as thoon turn’d him round,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wounded him as he was turning round.</p>
    <p class=l>transpierced his back with a dishonest wound:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he laid open the vein that</p>
    <p class=l>the hollow vein, that to the neck extends</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>runs all the way up the back to the neck; he cut this vein clean</p>
    <p class=l>along the chine, his eager javelin rends:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>away throughout its whole course, and thoon fell in the dust face</p>
    <p class=l>supine he falls, and to his social train</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upwards, stretching out his hands imploringly towards his<br />comrades.</p>
    <p class=l>spreads his imploring arms, but spreads in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>antilochus sprang upon him and stripped the armour from</p>
    <p class=l>thv exulting victor, leaping where he lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his shoulders, glaring round him fearfully as he did so.</p>
    <p class=l>from his broad shoulders tore the spoils away;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>his time observed; for closed by foes around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans came about him on every side and struck his broad and</p>
    <p class=l>on all sides thick the peals of arms resound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gleaming shield, but could not wound his body, for neptune stood</p>
    <p class=l>his shield emboss’d the ringing storm sustains,<br />but he impervious and untouch’d remains.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>guard over the son of nestor, though the darts fell thickly round</p>
    <p class=l>(great neptune’s care preserved from hostile rage<br />this youth, the joy of nestor’s glorious age.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him.</p>
    <p class=l>)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was never clear of the foe, but was always in the thick</p>
    <p class=l>in arms intrepid, with the first he fought,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the fight; his spear was never idle; he poised and aimed it in</p>
    <p class=l>faced every foe, and every danger sought;<br />his winged lance, resistless as the wind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>every direction, so eager was he to hit someone from a distance</p>
    <p class=l>obeys each motion of the master’s mind!<br />restless it flies, impatient to be free,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or to fight him hand to hand.</p>
    <p class=l>and meditates the distant enemy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by adamas, son</p>
    <p class=l>the son of asius, adamas, drew near,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of asius, who rushed towards him and struck him with a spear in</p>
    <p class=l>and struck his target with the brazen spear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the middle of his shield, but neptune made its point without</p>
    <p class=l>fierce in his front: but neptune wards the blow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>effect, for he grudged him the life of antilochus.</p>
    <p class=l>and blunts the javelin of th’ eluded foe:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one half,<br />therefore, of the spear stuck fast like a charred stake in</p>
    <p class=l>in the broad buckler half the weapon stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>antilochus’s shield, while the other lay on the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>splinter’d on earth flew half the broken wood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>adamas</p>
    <p class=l>disarm’d, he mingled in the trojan crew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then sought shelter under cover of his men, but meriones followed</p>
    <p class=l>but merion’s spear o’ertook him as he flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after and hit him with a spear midway between the private parts</p>
    <p class=l>deep in the belly’s rim an entrance found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and the navel, where a wound is particularly painful to wretched</p>
    <p class=l>where sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound.<br />bending he fell, and doubled to the ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mortals.</p>
    <p class=l>lay panting.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there did meriones transfix him, and he writhed</p>
    <p class=l>thus an ox in fetters tied,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>convulsively about the spear as some bull whom mountain herdsmen</p>
    <p class=l>while death’s strong pangs distend his labouring side,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have bound with ropes of withes and are taking away perforce.</p>
    <p class=l>his bulk enormous on the field displays;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so did he move convulsively for a while, but not for very</p>
    <p class=l>his heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>long, till meriones came up and drew the spear out of his body,</p>
    <p class=l>the spear the conqueror from his body drew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and his eyes were veiled in darkness.</p>
    <p class=l>and death’s dim shadows swarm before his view.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>helenus then struck deipyrus with a great thracian sword, hitting</p>
    <p class=l>next brave deipyrus in dust was laid:<br />king helenus waved high the thracian blade,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him on the temple in close combat and tearing the helmet from his</p>
    <p class=l>and smote his temples with an arm so strong,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>head; the helmet fell to the ground, and one of those who were</p>
    <p class=l>the helm fell off, and roll’d amid the throng:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fighting on the achaean side took charge of it as it rolled at</p>
    <p class=l>there for some luckier greek it rests a prize;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his feet, but the eyes of deipyrus were closed in the darkness of<br />death.</p>
    <p class=l>for dark in death the godlike owner lies!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards</p>
    <p class=l>raging with grief, great menelaus burns,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>helenus, brandishing his spear; but helenus drew his bow, and the</p>
    <p class=l>and fraught with vengeance, to the victor turns:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two attacked one another at one and the same moment, the one with</p>
    <p class=l>that shook the ponderous lance, in act to throw;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his spear, and the other with his bow and arrow.</p>
    <p class=l>and this stood adverse with the bended bow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of priam<br />hit the breastplate of menelaus’s corslet, but the arrow glanced</p>
    <p class=l>full on his breast the trojan arrow fell,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from off it.</p>
    <p class=l>but harmless bounded from the plated steel.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as black beans or pulse come pattering down on to a<br />threshing-floor from the broad winnowing-shovel, blown by shrill</p>
    <p class=l>as on some ample barn’s well harden’d floor,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>winds and shaken by the shovel—even so did the arrow glance off</p>
    <p class=l>(the winds collected at each open door,)<br />while the broad fan with force is whirl’d around,<br />light leaps the golden grain, resulting from the ground:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and recoil from the shield of menelaus, who in his turn wounded</p>
    <p class=l>so from the steel that guards atrides’ heart,<br />repell’d to distance flies the bounding dart.<br />atrides, watchful of the unwary foe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the hand with which helenus carried his bow; the spear went right<br />through his hand and stuck in the bow itself, so that to his life</p>
    <p class=l>pierced with his lance the hand that grasp’d the bow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he retreated under cover of his men, with his hand dragging by</p>
    <p class=l>and nailed it to the yew: the wounded hand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his side—for the spear weighed it down till agenor drew it out</p>
    <p class=l>trail’d the long lance that mark’d with blood the sand:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and bound the hand carefully up in a woollen sling which his</p>
    <p class=l>but good agenor gently from the wound<br />the spear solicits, and the bandage bound;<br />a sling’s soft wool, snatch’d from a soldier’s side,<br />at once the tent and ligature supplied.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>esquire had with him.</p>
    <p class=l>behold!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pisander then made straight at menelaus—his evil destiny luring</p>
    <p class=l>pisander, urged by fate’s decree,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him on to his doom, for he was to fall in fight with you, o</p>
    <p class=l>springs through the ranks to fall, and fall by thee,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus.</p>
    <p class=l>great menelaus!<br />to enchance thy fame:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the two were hard by one another the spear of the</p>
    <p class=l>high-towering in the front, the warrior came.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of atreus turned aside and he missed his aim; pisander then</p>
    <p class=l>first the sharp lance was by atrides thrown;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>struck the shield of brave menelaus but could not pierce it, for</p>
    <p class=l>the lance far distant by the winds was blown.<br />nor pierced pisander through atrides’ shield:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the shield stayed the spear and broke the shaft; nevertheless he</p>
    <p class=l>pisander’s spear fell shiver’d on the field.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was glad and made sure of victory; forthwith, however, the son of</p>
    <p class=l>not so discouraged, to the future blind,<br />vain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus drew his sword and sprang upon him.</p>
    <p class=l>dauntless he rushes where the spartan lord<br />like lightning brandish’d his far beaming sword.<br />his left arm high opposed the shining shield:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pisander then seized</p>
    <p class=l>his right beneath, the cover’d pole-axe held;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the bronze battle-axe, with its long and polished handle of olive</p>
    <p class=l>(an olive’s cloudy grain the handle made,<br />distinct with studs, and brazen was the blade;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wood that hung by his side under his shield, and the two made at</p>
    <p class=l>this on the helm discharged a noble blow;<br />the plume dropp’d nodding to the plain below,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one another.</p>
    <p class=l>shorn from the crest.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pisander struck the peak of menelaus’s crested</p>
    <p class=l>atrides waved his steel:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>helmet just under the crest itself, and menelaus hit pisander as</p>
    <p class=l>deep through his front the weighty falchion fell;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was coming towards him, on the forehead, just at the rise of</p>
    <p class=l>the crashing bones before its force gave way;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his nose; the bones cracked and his two gore-bedrabbled eyes fell</p>
    <p class=l>in dust and blood the groaning hero lay:<br />forced from their ghastly orbs, and spouting gore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by his feet in the dust.</p>
    <p class=l>the clotted eye-balls tumble on the shore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he fell backwards to the ground, and</p>
    <p class=l>and fierce atrides spurn’d him as he bled,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus set his heel upon him, stripped him of his armour, and</p>
    <p class=l>tore off his arms, and, loud-exulting, said:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vaunted over him saying, “even thus shall you trojans leave the</p>
    <p class=l>“thus, trojans, thus, at length be taught to fear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships of the achaeans, proud and insatiate of battle though you</p>
    <p class=l>o race perfidious, who delight in war!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be, nor shall you lack any of the disgrace and shame which you</p>
    <p class=l>already noble deeds ye have perform’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have heaped upon myself.</p>
    <p class=l>a princess raped transcends a navy storm’d:</p>

    <p class=r>cowardly she-wolves that you are, you</p>
    <p class=l>in such bold feats your impious might approve,</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>without th’ assistance, or the fear of jove.</p>

    <p class=r>hospitality, who will one day destroy your city; you stole my<br />wedded wife and wickedly carried off much treasure when you were</p>
    <p class=l>the violated rites, the ravish’d dame;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her guest, and now you would fling fire upon our ships, and kill<br />our heroes.</p>
    <p class=l>our heroes slaughter’d and our ships on flame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a day will come when, rage as you may, you shall be</p>
    <p class=l>crimes heap’d on crimes, shall bend your glory down,</p>

    <p class=r>overweening, that they are never tired of fighting?</p>
    <p class=l>still breathing rapine, violence, and lust?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all things</p>
    <p class=l>the best of things, beyond their measure, cloy;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pall after a while—sleep, love, sweet song, and stately</p>
    <p class=l>sleep’s balmy blessing, love’s endearing joy;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dance—still these are things of which a man would surely have his</p>
    <p class=l>the feast, the dance; whate’er mankind desire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fill rather than of battle, whereas it is of battle that the</p>
    <p class=l>even the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans are insatiate.</p>
    <p class=l>but troy for ever reaps a dire delight<br />in thirst of slaughter, and in lust of fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so saying menelaus stripped the blood-stained armour from the</p>
    <p class=l>this said, he seized (while yet the carcase heaved)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body of pisander, and handed it over to his men; then he again</p>
    <p class=l>the bloody armour, which his train received:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ranged himself among those who were in the front of the fight.</p>
    <p class=l>then sudden mix’d among the warring crew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>harpalion son of king pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had</p>
    <p class=l>and the bold son of pylæmenes slew.<br />harpalion had through asia travell’d far,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come to fight at troy along with his father, but he did not go</p>
    <p class=l>following his martial father to the war:<br />through filial love he left his native shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>home again.</p>
    <p class=l>never, ah, never to behold it more!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he struck the middle of menelaus’s shield with his<br />spear but could not pierce it, and to save his life drew back</p>
    <p class=l>his unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>under cover of his men, looking round him on every side lest he</p>
    <p class=l>against the target of the spartan king;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should be wounded.</p>
    <p class=l>thus of his lance disarm’d, from death he flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but meriones aimed a bronze-tipped arrow at</p>
    <p class=l>and turns around his apprehensive eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him as he was leaving the field, and hit him on the right</p>
    <p class=l>him, through the hip transpiercing as he fled,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>buttock; the arrow pierced the bone through and through, and</p>
    <p class=l>the shaft of merion mingled with the dead.<br />beneath the bone the glancing point descends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>penetrated the bladder, so he sat down where he was and breathed</p>
    <p class=l>and, driving down, the swelling bladder rends:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his last in the arms of his comrades, stretched like a worm upon</p>
    <p class=l>sunk in his sad companions’ arms he lay,<br />and in short pantings sobb’d his soul away;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ground and watering the earth with the blood that flowed from</p>
    <p class=l>(like some vile worm extended on the ground;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his wound.</p>
    <p class=l>while life’s red torrent gush’d from out the wound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the brave paphlagonians tended him with all due care;</p>
    <p class=l>him on his car the paphlagonian train</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they raised him into his chariot, and bore him sadly off to the</p>
    <p class=l>in slow procession bore from off the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>city of troy; his father went also with him weeping bitterly, but</p>
    <p class=l>the pensive father, father now no more!<br />attends the mournful pomp along the shore;<br />and unavailing tears profusely shed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there was no ransom that could bring his dead son to life again.</p>
    <p class=l>and, unrevenged, deplored his offspring dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>paris was deeply grieved by the death of harpalion, who was his</p>
    <p class=l>paris from far the moving sight beheld,<br />with pity soften’d and with fury swell’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>host when he went among the paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow,</p>
    <p class=l>his honour’d host, a youth of matchless grace,<br />and loved of all the paphlagonian race!<br />with his full strength he bent his angry bow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, in order to avenge him.</p>
    <p class=l>and wing’d the feather’d vengeance at the foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now there was a certain man<br />named euchenor, son of polyidus the prophet, a brave man and</p>
    <p class=l>a chief there was, the brave euchenor named,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wealthy, whose home was in corinth.</p>
    <p class=l>for riches much, and more for virtue famed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this euchenor had set sail</p>
    <p class=l>who held his seat in corinth’s stately town;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for troy well knowing that it would be the death of him, for his</p>
    <p class=l>polydus’ son, a seer of old renown.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>good old father polyidus had often told him that he must either</p>
    <p class=l>oft had the father told his early doom,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stay at home and die of a terrible disease, or go with the</p>
    <p class=l>by arms abroad, or slow disease at home:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans and perish at the hands of the trojans; he chose,<br />therefore, to avoid incurring the heavy fine the achaeans would<br />have laid upon him, and at the same time to escape the pain and</p>
    <p class=l>he climb’d his vessel, prodigal of breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>suffering of disease.</p>
    <p class=l>and chose the certain glorious path to death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>paris now smote him on the jaw under his</p>
    <p class=l>beneath his ear the pointed arrow went;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ear, whereon the life went out of him and he was enshrouded in</p>
    <p class=l>the soul came issuing at the narrow vent:<br />his limbs, unnerved, drop useless on the ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the darkness of death.</p>
    <p class=l>and everlasting darkness shades him round.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire.<br />but hector<br />had not yet heard, and did not know that the argives were making</p>
    <p class=l>nor knew great hector how his legions yield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>havoc of his men on the left wing of the battle, where the</p>
    <p class=l>(wrapp’d in the cloud and tumult of the field:)<br />wide on the left the force of greece commands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans ere long would have triumphed over them, so vigorously</p>
    <p class=l>and conquest hovers o’er th’ achaian bands;<br />with such a tide superior virtue sway’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did neptune cheer them on and help them.</p>
    <p class=l>and he that shakes the solid earth gave aid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he therefore held on at</p>
    <p class=l>but in the centre hector fix’d remain’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the point where he had first forced his way through the gates and</p>
    <p class=l>where first the gates were forced, and bulwarks gain’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the wall, after breaking through the serried ranks of danaan</p>
    <p class=l>there, on the margin of the hoary deep,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>warriors.<br />it was here that the ships of ajax and protesilaus were</p>
    <p class=l>(their naval station where the ajaces keep.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drawn up by the sea-shore; here the wall was at its lowest, and</p>
    <p class=l>and where low walls confine the beating tides,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fight both of man and horse raged most fiercely.</p>
    <p class=l>whose humble barrier scarce the foe divides;<br />where late in fight both foot and horse engaged,<br />and all the thunder of the battle raged,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>there join’d, the whole bœotian strength remains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>boeotians and the ionians with their long tunics, the locrians,</p>
    <p class=l>the proud iaonians with their sweeping trains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the men of phthia, and the famous force of the epeans could</p>
    <p class=l>locrians and phthians, and th’ epaean force;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hardly stay hector as he rushed on towards the ships, nor could</p>
    <p class=l>but join’d, repel not hector’s fiery course.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they drive him from them, for he was as a wall of fire.</p>
    <p class=l>the flower of athens, stichius, phidas, led;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>bias and great menestheus at their head:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chosen men of the athenians were in the van, led by menestheus</p>
    <p class=l>meges the strong the epaean bands controll’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of peteos, with whom were also pheidas, stichius, and</p>
    <p class=l>and dracius prudent, and amphion bold:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stalwart bias; meges son of phyleus, amphion, and dracius</p>
    <p class=l>the phthians, medon, famed for martial might,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>commanded the epeans, while medon and staunch podarces led the</p>
    <p class=l>and brave podarces, active in the fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men of phthia.</p>
    <p class=l>this drew from phylacus his noble line;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of these, medon was bastard son to oileus and</p>
    <p class=l>iphiclus’ son: and that (oïleus) thine:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brother of ajax, but he lived in phylace away from his own</p>
    <p class=l>(young ajax’ brother, by a stolen embrace;<br />he dwelt far distant from his native place,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>country, for he had killed the brother of his stepmother eriopis,</p>
    <p class=l>by his fierce step-dame from his father’s reign</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the wife of oileus; the other, podarces, was the son of iphiclus,<br />son of phylacus.</p>
    <p class=l>expell’d and exiled for her brother slain:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these two stood in the van of the phthians, and</p>
    <p class=l>these rule the phthians, and their arms employ,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>defended the ships along with the boeotians.</p>
    <p class=l>mix’d with bœotians, on the shores of troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax son of oileus, never for a moment left the side of ajax, son</p>
    <p class=l>now side by side, with like unwearied care,<br />each ajax laboured through the field of war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of telamon, but as two swart oxen both strain their utmost at the</p>
    <p class=l>so when two lordly bulls, with equal toil,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>plough which they are drawing in a fallow field, and the sweat</p>
    <p class=l>force the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>steams upwards from about the roots of their horns—nothing but</p>
    <p class=l>join’d to one yoke, the stubborn earth they tear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the yoke divides them as they break up the ground till they reach</p>
    <p class=l>and trace large furrows with the shining share;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the end of the field—even so did the two ajaxes stand shoulder to</p>
    <p class=l>o’er their huge limbs the foam descends in snow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shoulder by one another.</p>
    <p class=l>and streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many and brave comrades followed the son</p>
    <p class=l>a train of heroes followed through the field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of telamon, to relieve him of his shield when he was overcome</p>
    <p class=l>who bore by turns great ajax’ sevenfold shield;<br />whene’er he breathed, remissive of his might,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with sweat and toil, but the locrians did not follow so close</p>
    <p class=l>tired with the incessant slaughters of the fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after the son of oileus, for they could not hold their own in a</p>
    <p class=l>no following troops his brave associate grace:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hand-to-hand fight.</p>
    <p class=l>in close engagement an unpractised race,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they had no bronze helmets with plumes of</p>
    <p class=l>the locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horse-hair, neither had they shields nor ashen spears, but they</p>
    <p class=l>nor bear the helm, nor lift the moony shield;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had come to troy armed with bows, and with slings of twisted wool</p>
    <p class=l>but skill’d from far the flying shaft to wing,<br />or whirl the sounding pebble from the sling,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from which they showered their missiles to break the ranks of the</p>
    <p class=l>dexterous with these they aim a certain wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>or fell the distant warrior to the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the others, therefore, with their heavy armour bore the</p>
    <p class=l>thus in the van the telamonian train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brunt of the fight with the trojans and with hector, while the</p>
    <p class=l>throng’d in bright arms, a pressing fight maintain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>locrians shot from behind, under their cover; and thus the</p>
    <p class=l>far in the rear the locrian archers lie,<br />whose stones and arrows intercept the sky,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans began to lose heart, for the arrows threw them into</p>
    <p class=l>the mingled tempest on the foes they pour;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>confusion.</p>
    <p class=l>troy’s scattering orders open to the shower.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from the</p>
    <p class=l>now had the greeks eternal fame acquired,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships and tents back to windy ilius, had not polydamas presently</p>
    <p class=l>and the gall’d ilians to their walls retired;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said to hector, “hector, there is no persuading you to take</p>
    <p class=l>but sage polydamas, discreetly brave,<br />address’d great hector, and this counsel gave:<br />“though great in all, thou seem’st averse to lend</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>advice.</p>
    <p class=l>impartial audience to a faithful friend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>because heaven has so richly endowed you with the arts of</p>
    <p class=l>to gods and men thy matchless worth is known,<br />and every art of glorious war thy own;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>war, you think that you must therefore excel others in counsel;</p>
    <p class=l>but in cool thought and counsel to excel,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but you cannot thus claim preeminence in all things.</p>
    <p class=l>how widely differs this from warring well!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heaven has</p>
    <p class=l>content with what the bounteous gods have given,<br />seek not alone to engross the gifts of heaven.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>made one man an excellent soldier; of another it has made a</p>
    <p class=l>to some the powers of bloody war belong,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dancer or a singer and player on the lyre; while yet in another</p>
    <p class=l>to some sweet music and the charm of song;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove has implanted a wise understanding of which men reap fruit</p>
    <p class=l>to few, and wondrous few, has jove assign’d<br />a wise, extensive, all-considering mind;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to the saving of many, and he himself knows more about it than</p>
    <p class=l>their guardians these, the nations round confess,<br />and towns and empires for their safety bless.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>any one; therefore i will say what i think will be best.</p>
    <p class=l>if heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>attend, o hector!<br />what i judge the best,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight has hemmed you in as with a circle of fire, and even now</p>
    <p class=l>see, as thou mov’st, on dangers dangers spread,<br />and war’s whole fury burns around thy head.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that the trojans are within the wall some of them stand aloof in</p>
    <p class=l>behold!<br />distress’d within yon hostile wall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>full armour, while others are fighting scattered and outnumbered</p>
    <p class=l>how many trojans yield, disperse, or fall!<br />what troops, out-number’d, scarce the war maintain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>near the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>and what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>draw back, therefore, and call your chieftains</p>
    <p class=l>here cease thy fury: and, the chiefs and kings</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>round you, that we may advise together whether to fall now upon</p>
    <p class=l>convoked to council, weigh the sum of things.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ships in the hope that heaven may vouchsafe us victory, or to</p>
    <p class=l>whether (the gods succeeding our desires)<br />to yon tall ships to bear the trojan fires;<br />or quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beat a retreat while we can yet safely do so.</p>
    <p class=l>contented with the conquest of the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i greatly fear that</p>
    <p class=l>i fear, i fear, lest greece, not yet undone,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans will pay us their debt of yesterday in full, for</p>
    <p class=l>pay the large debt of last revolving sun;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there is one abiding at their ships who is never weary of battle,</p>
    <p class=l>achilles, great achilles, yet remains</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and who will not hold aloof much longer.</p>
    <p class=l>on yonder decks, and yet o’erlooks the plains!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus spoke polydamas, and his words pleased hector well.</p>
    <p class=l>the counsel pleased; and hector, with a bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>leap’d from his chariot on the trembling ground;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sprang in full armour from his chariot and said, “polydamas,</p>
    <p class=l>swift as he leap’d his clanging arms resound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gather the chieftains here; i will go yonder into the fight, but</p>
    <p class=l>“to guard this post (he cried) thy art employ,<br />and here detain the scatter’d youth of troy;<br />where yonder heroes faint, i bend my way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will return at once when i have given them their orders.</p>
    <p class=l>and hasten back to end the doubtful day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, and with a</p>
    <p class=l>this said, the towering chief prepares to go,<br />shakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow,<br />and seems a moving mountain topp’d with snow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>loud cry flew through the ranks of the trojans and their allies.</p>
    <p class=l>through all his host, inspiring force, he flies,<br />and bids anew the martial thunder rise.<br />to panthus’ son, at hector’s high command<br />haste the bold leaders of the trojan band:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they heard his voice they all hastened to gather round</p>
    <p class=l>but round the battlements, and round the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>polydamas, the excellent son of panthous, but hector kept on</p>
    <p class=l>for many a chief he look’d, but look’d in vain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among the foremost, looking everywhere to find deiphobus and</p>
    <p class=l>deiphobus, nor helenus the seer,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>prince helenus, adamas son of asius, and asius son of hyrtacus;</p>
    <p class=l>nor asius’ son, nor asius’ self appear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>living, indeed, and scatheless he could no longer find them, for</p>
    <p class=l>for these were pierced with many a ghastly wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the two last were lying by the sterns of the achaean ships, slain</p>
    <p class=l>some cold in death, some groaning on the ground;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by the argives, while the others had been also stricken and</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from the moment when you set our men fighting<br />about the ships we have been staying here and doing battle with</p>
    <p class=l>the chiefs you seek on yonder shore lie slain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the danaans.<br />our comrades about whom you ask me are dead;</p>

    <p class=r>the blasts of some fierce wind that strike earth in the van of a</p>

    <p class=l>chief urged on chief, and man drove man along.</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>far o’er the plains, in dreadful order bright,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of priam, peer of murderous mars, with his round shield before</p>
    <p class=l>the brazen arms reflect a beamy light:<br />full in the blazing van great hector shined,<br />like mars commission’d to confound mankind.<br />before him flaming his enormous shield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him—his shield of ox-hides covered with plates of bronze—and his</p>
    <p class=l>like the broad sun, illumined all the field;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gleaming helmet upon his temples.</p>
    <p class=l>his nodding helm emits a streamy ray;<br />his piercing eyes through all the battle stray,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he kept stepping forward under</p>

    <p class=l>shot terrors round, that wither’d e’en the strong.</p>

    <p class=r>the courage of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>whole nations fear’d; but not an argive shook.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax was the first to stride out and</p>
    <p class=l>the towering ajax, with an ample stride,<br />advanced the first, and thus the chief defied:</p>

    <p class=l>“hector!</p>

    <p class=r>“sir,” he cried, “draw near; why do you think thus</p>

    <p class=r>as he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, and</p>
    <p class=l>as thus he spoke, behold, in open view,<br />on sounding wings a dexter eagle flew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the host of the achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the</p>
    <p class=l>to jove’s glad omen all the grecians rise,<br />and hail, with shouts, his progress through the skies:<br />far-echoing clamours bound from side to side;<br />they ceased; and thus the chief of troy replied:<br />“from whence this menace, this insulting strain?</p>

    <p class=r>with these words he led the way and the others followed after</p>
    <p class=l>he said; and like a lion stalk’d along:<br />with shouts incessant earth and ocean rung,<br />sent from his following host: the grecian train</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with a cry that rent the air, while the host shouted behind them.<br />the argives on their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they<br />forget their prowess, but stood firm against the onslaught of the</p>
    <p class=l>with answering thunders fill’d the echoing plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojan chieftains, and the cry from both the hosts rose up to</p>
    <p class=l>a shout that tore heaven’s concave, and, above,</p>

    <p class=l>and best defence, lies smoking on the ground:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans are fighting stubbornly and without ceasing at the ships;</p>
    <p class=l>even to the ships their conquering arms extend,<br />and groans of slaughter’d greeks to heaven ascend.</p>

    <p class=r>the achaeans is coming; they are being killed in a confused mass</p>
    <p class=l>in such distress!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can be of any use, what we had better do; but i do not advise our</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>going into battle ourselves, for a man cannot fight when he is</p>
    <p class=l>these gaping wounds withhold us from the fight.</p>

    <p class=r>wounded.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and king agamemnon answered, “nestor, if the trojans are indeed</p>

    <p class=l>that troy triumphant our high fleet ascends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which they deemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and</p>
    <p class=l>and that the rampart, late our surest trust<br />and best defence, lies smoking in the dust;</p>

    <p class=r>our fleet—i see it must be the will of jove that the achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>all this from jove’s afflictive hand we bear,</p>

    <p class=r>should perish ingloriously here, far from argos.</p>
    <p class=l>who, far from argos, wills our ruin here.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i knew when jove</p>
    <p class=l>past are the days when happier greece was blest,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was willing to defend us, and i know now that he is raising the</p>

    <p class=l>cease we at length to waste our blood in vain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as i say; let us bring down the ships that are on the beach and<br />draw them into the water; let us make them fast to their</p>

    <p class=r>ulysses looked fiercely at him and said, “son of atreus, what are</p>

    <p class=r>agamemnon answered, “ulysses, your rebuke has stung me to the</p>

    <p class=r>then said diomed, “such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are true or no; therefore when i say well despise not my words as<br />though i were a coward or of ignoble birth.</p>

    <p class=r>thus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set</p>
    <p class=l>he added not: the listening kings obey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>out, king agamemnon leading the way.</p>
    <p class=l>slow moving on; atrides leads the way.</p>

    <p class=r>meanwhile neptune had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them</p>
    <p class=l>the god of ocean (to inflame their rage)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the semblance of an old man.</p>
    <p class=l>appears a warrior furrowed o’er with age;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he took agamemnon’s right hand in</p>
    <p class=l>press’d in his own, the general’s hand he took,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his own and said, “son of atreus, i take it achilles is glad now</p>
    <p class=l>and thus the venerable hero spoke:<br />“atrides!<br />lo!</p>

    <p class=r>that he sees the achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly</p>
    <p class=l>with what disdainful eye<br />achilles sees his country’s forces fly;<br />blind, impious man!<br />whose anger is his guide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>without remorse—may he come to a bad end and heaven confound him.</p>
    <p class=l>who glories in unutterable pride.<br />so may he perish, so may jove disclaim</p>

    <p class=r>as for yourself, the blessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry</p>
    <p class=l>the wretch relentless, and o’erwhelm with shame!<br />but heaven forsakes not thee: o’er yonder sands</p>

    <p class=r>with you but that the princes and counsellors of the trojans</p>
    <p class=l>soon shall thou view the scattered trojan bands<br />fly diverse; while proud kings, and chiefs renown’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall again raise the dust upon the plain, and you shall see them</p>
    <p class=l>driven heaps on heaps, with clouds involved around<br />of rolling dust, their winged wheels employ</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flying from the ships and tents towards their city.</p>
    <p class=l>to hide their ignominious heads in troy.</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward to</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, then rush’d amid the warrior crew,<br />and sent his voice before him as he flew,<br />loud, as the shout encountering armies yield</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the plain.</p>
    <p class=l>when twice ten thousand shake the labouring field;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the voice that came from his deep chest was as that of</p>
    <p class=l>such was the voice, and such the thundering sound</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nine or ten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a</p>
    <p class=l>of him whose trident rends the solid ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight, and it put fresh courage into the hearts of the achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>each argive bosom beats to meet the fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to wage war and do battle without ceasing.</p>
    <p class=l>and grisly war appears a pleasing sight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>juno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak of</p>
    <p class=l>meantime saturnia from olympus’ brow,<br />high-throned in gold, beheld the fields below;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>olympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him who was</p>
    <p class=l>with joy the glorious conflict she survey’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at once her brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and</p>
    <p class=l>where her great brother gave the grecians aid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thither amid the fighting.</p>
    <p class=l>but placed aloft, on ida’s shady height</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then she turned her eyes to jove as he</p>
    <p class=l>she sees her jove, and trembles at the sight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sat on the topmost crests of many-fountained ida, and loathed</p>
    <p class=l>jove to deceive, what methods shall she try,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him.</p>
    <p class=l>what arts, to blind his all-beholding eye?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she set herself to think how she might hoodwink him, and in<br />the end she deemed that it would be best for her to go to ida and</p>
    <p class=l>at length she trusts her power; resolved to prove</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>array herself in rich attire, in the hope that jove might become</p>
    <p class=l>the old, yet still successful, cheat of love;<br />against his wisdom to oppose her charms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>enamoured of her, and wish to embrace her.</p>
    <p class=l>and lull the lord of thunders in her arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while he was thus</p>
    <p class=l>swift to her bright apartment she repairs,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>engaged a sweet and careless sleep might be made to steal over<br />his eyes and senses.</p>
    <p class=l>sacred to dress and beauty’s pleasing cares:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she went, therefore, to the room which her son vulcan had made</p>
    <p class=l>with skill divine had vulcan form’d the bower,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her, and the doors of which he had cunningly fastened by means of</p>
    <p class=l>safe from access of each intruding power.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a secret key so that no other god could open them.<br />here she</p>
    <p class=l>touch’d with her secret key, the doors unfold:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>entered and closed the doors behind her.</p>
    <p class=l>self-closed, behind her shut the valves of gold.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she cleansed all the<br />dirt from her fair body with ambrosia, then she anointed herself</p>
    <p class=l>here first she bathes; and round her body pours</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with olive oil, ambrosial, very soft, and scented specially for</p>
    <p class=l>soft oils of fragrance, and ambrosial showers:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>herself—if it were so much as shaken in the bronze-floored house</p>
    <p class=l>the winds, perfumed, the balmy gale convey</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of jove, the scent pervaded the universe of heaven and earth.</p>
    <p class=l>through heaven, through earth, and all the aerial way:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this she anointed her delicate skin, and then she plaited</p>
    <p class=l>spirit divine!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fair ambrosial locks that flowed in a stream of golden</p>
    <p class=l>whose exhalation greets</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tresses from her immortal head.</p>
    <p class=l>the sense of gods with more than mortal sweets.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she put on the wondrous robe</p>
    <p class=l>thus while she breathed of heaven, with decent pride</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which minerva had worked for her with consummate art, and had</p>
    <p class=l>her artful hands the radiant tresses tied;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>embroidered with manifold devices; she fastened it about her</p>
    <p class=l>part on her head in shining ringlets roll’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bosom with golden clasps, and she girded herself with a girdle</p>
    <p class=l>part o’er her shoulders waved like melted gold.<br />around her next a heavenly mantle flow’d,<br />that rich with pallas’ labour’d colours glow’d:<br />large clasps of gold the foldings gather’d round,<br />a golden zone her swelling bosom bound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that had a hundred tassels: then she fastened her earrings, three</p>
    <p class=l>far-beaming pendants tremble in her ear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brilliant pendants that glistened most beautifully, through the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pierced lobes of her ears, and threw a lovely new veil over her</p>
    <p class=l>then o’er her head she cast a veil more white</p>

    <p class=r>head.</p>
    <p class=l>than new-fallen snow, and dazzling as the light.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she bound her sandals on to her feet, and when she had</p>
    <p class=l>last her fair feet celestial sandals grace.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>arrayed herself perfectly to her satisfaction, she left her room</p>
    <p class=l>thus issuing radiant with majestic pace,<br />forth from the dome the imperial goddess moves,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and called venus to come aside and speak to her.</p>
    <p class=l>and calls the mother of the smiles and loves.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my dear child,”</p>
    <p class=l>“how long (to venus thus apart she cried)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said she, “will you do what i am going to ask of you, or will you</p>
    <p class=l>shall human strife celestial minds divide?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>refuse me because you are angry at my being on the danaan side,</p>
    <p class=l>ah yet, will venus aid saturnia’s joy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while you are on the trojan?</p>
    <p class=l>and set aside the cause of greece and troy?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove’s daughter venus answered, “juno, august queen of goddesses,</p>
    <p class=l>“let heaven’s dread empress (cytheraea said)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>daughter of mighty saturn, say what you want, and i will do it<br />for you at once, if i can, and if it can be done at all.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then juno told her a lying tale and said, “i want you to endow me</p>
    <p class=l>“then grant me (said the queen) those conquering charms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with some of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring</p>
    <p class=l>that power, which mortals and immortals warms,<br />that love, which melts mankind in fierce desires,</p>

    <p class=r>all things mortal and immortal to your feet.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mother tethys: they received me in their house, took care of me,</p>
    <p class=l>in their kind arms my tender years were past;</p>

    <p class=r>and brought me up, having taken me over from rhaea when jove</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>imprisoned great saturn in the depths that are under earth and</p>

    <p class=r>i must go and see them that i may make peace between them;</p>
    <p class=l>which held so long that ancient pair in peace.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they have been quarrelling, and are so angry that they have not</p>
    <p class=l>what honour, and what love, shall i obtain,</p>

    <p class=r>slept with one another this long while; if i can bring them round</p>
    <p class=l>if i compose those fatal feuds again;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and restore them to one another’s embraces, they will be grateful</p>
    <p class=l>once more their minds in mutual ties engage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to me and love me for ever afterwards.</p>
    <p class=l>and, what my youth has owed, repay their age!</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon laughter-loving venus said, “i cannot and must not refuse</p>
    <p class=l>she said.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you, for you sleep in the arms of jove who is our king.</p>
    <p class=l>with awe divine, the queen of love</p>

    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>obey’d the sister and the wife of jove;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroidered</p>
    <p class=l>and from her fragrant breast the zone embraced,[233]<br />with various skill and high embroidery graced.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>girdle into which all her charms had been wrought—love, desire,</p>
    <p class=l>in this was every art, and every charm,<br />to win the wisest, and the coldest warm:<br />fond love, the gentle vow, the gay desire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and that sweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the</p>
    <p class=l>the kind deceit, the still-reviving fire,<br />persuasive speech, and the more persuasive sighs,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>most prudent.</p>
    <p class=l>silence that spoke, and eloquence of eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she gave the girdle to juno and said, “take this</p>
    <p class=l>this on her hand the cyprian goddess laid:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>girdle wherein all my charms reside and lay it in your bosom.<br />if<br />you will wear it i promise you that your errand, be it what it</p>
    <p class=l>“take this, and with it all thy wish;” she said.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may, will not be bootless.<br />”<br />when she heard this juno smiled, and still smiling she laid the</p>
    <p class=l>with smiles she took the charm; and smiling press’d</p>

    <p class=r>girdle in her bosom.</p>
    <p class=l>the powerful cestus to her snowy breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>venus now went back into the house of jove, while juno darted</p>
    <p class=l>then venus to the courts of jove withdrew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>down from the summits of olympus.</p>
    <p class=l>whilst from olympus pleased saturnia flew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she passed over pieria and fair</p>
    <p class=l>o’er high pieria thence her course she bore,<br />o’er fair emathia’s ever-pleasing shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>emathia, and went on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of<br />the thracian horsemen, over whose topmost crests she sped without</p>
    <p class=l>o’er hemus’ hills with snows eternal crown’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ever setting foot to ground.</p>
    <p class=l>nor once her flying foot approach’d the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when she came to athos she went on</p>
    <p class=l>then taking wing from athos’ lofty steep,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over the waves of the sea till she reached lemnos, the city of</p>
    <p class=l>she speeds to lemnos o’er the rolling deep,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>noble thoas.<br />there she met sleep, own brother to death, and</p>
    <p class=l>and seeks the cave of death’s half-brother, sleep.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>caught him by the hand, saying, “sleep, you who lord it alike</p>
    <p class=l>[234]<br />“sweet pleasing sleep!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>past, do one for me now, and i shall be grateful to you ever</p>
    <p class=l>if e’er obsequious to thy juno’s will,</p>

    <p class=r>after.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>clasped in my embrace, and i will give you a beautiful golden</p>
    <p class=l>a splendid footstool, and a throne, that shine<br />with gold unfading, somnus, shall be thine;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seat, that can never fall to pieces; my clubfooted son vulcan<br />shall make it for you, and he shall give it a footstool for you</p>
    <p class=l>the work of vulcan; to indulge thy ease,</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then sleep answered, “juno, great queen of goddesses, daughter of</p>
    <p class=l>“imperial dame (the balmy power replies),<br />great saturn’s heir, and empress of the skies!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty saturn, i would lull any other of the gods to sleep</p>

    <p class=r>without compunction, not even excepting the waters of oceanus</p>

    <p class=r>from whom all of them proceed, but i dare not go near jove, nor</p>
    <p class=l>but how, unbidden, shall i dare to steep<br />jove’s awful temples in the dew of sleep?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>send him to sleep unless he bids me.</p>
    <p class=l>long since, too venturous, at thy bold command,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have had one lesson</p>
    <p class=l>on those eternal lids i laid my hand;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>already through doing what you asked me, on the day when jove’s</p>
    <p class=l>what time, deserting ilion’s wasted plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty son hercules set sail from ilius after having sacked the</p>
    <p class=l>his conquering son, alcides, plough’d the main.</p>

    <p class=r>city of the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>when lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at your bidding i suffused my sweet self</p>
    <p class=l>the deeps arise, the tempests roar,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over the mind of aegis-bearing jove, and laid him to rest;<br />meanwhile you hatched a plot against hercules, and set the blasts<br />of the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you took him to the<br />goodly city of cos, away from all his friends.</p>
    <p class=l>and drive the hero to the coan shore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove was furious</p>
    <p class=l>great jove, awaking, shook the blest abodes</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he awoke, and began hurling the gods about all over the</p>
    <p class=l>with rising wrath, and tumbled gods on gods;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>house; he was looking more particularly for myself, and would</p>
    <p class=l>me chief he sought, and from the realms on high</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have flung me down through space into the sea where i should</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>never have been heard of any more, had not night who cows both<br />men and gods protected me.<br />i fled to her and jove left off<br />looking for me in spite of his being so angry, for he did not<br />dare do anything to displease night.</p>
    <p class=l>but gentle night, to whom i fled for aid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now you are again asking</p>
    <p class=l>(the friend of earth and heaven,) her wings display’d;<br />impower’d the wrath of gods and men to tame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me to do something on which i cannot venture.</p>
    <p class=l>even jove revered the venerable dame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and juno said, “sleep, why do you take such notions as those into</p>
    <p class=l>“vain are thy fears (the queen of heaven replies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your head?</p>
    <p class=l>and, speaking, rolls her large majestic eyes);</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do you think jove will be as anxious to help the</p>
    <p class=l>think’st thou that troy has jove’s high favour won,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans, as he was about his own son?</p>
    <p class=l>like great alcides, his all-conquering son?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come, i will marry you to</p>
    <p class=l>hear, and obey the mistress of the skies,</p>

    <p class=r>one of the youngest of the graces, and she shall be your</p>

    <p class=r>own—pasithea, whom you have always wanted to marry.</p>
    <p class=l>for know, thy loved-one shall be ever thine,<br />the youngest grace, pasithaë the divine.</p>

    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”[235]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, “then swear</p>
    <p class=l>“swear then (he said) by those tremendous floods</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it to me by the dread waters of the river styx; lay one hand on</p>
    <p class=l>that roar through hell, and bind the invoking gods:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the bounteous earth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so</p>
    <p class=l>let the great parent earth one hand sustain,<br />and stretch the other o’er the sacred main:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that all the gods who dwell down below with saturn may be our</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>witnesses, and see that you really do give me one of the youngest</p>
    <p class=l>to hear and witness from the depths of hell;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the graces—pasithea, whom i have always wanted to marry.</p>
    <p class=l>that she, my loved-one, shall be ever mine,<br />the youngest grace, pasithaë the divine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”<br />juno did as he had said.</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she swore, and invoked all the gods of</p>
    <p class=l>the queen assents, and from the infernal bowers<br />invokes the sable subtartarean powers,<br />and those who rule the inviolable floods,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the nether world, who are called titans, to witness.</p>
    <p class=l>whom mortals name the dread titanian gods.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when she had</p>
    <p class=l>[illustration: ] sleep escaping from the wrath of jupiter</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>completed her oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mist</p>
    <p class=l>then swift as wind, o’er lemnos’ smoky isle</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and sped lightly forward, leaving lemnos and imbrus behind them.</p>
    <p class=l>they wing their way, and imbrus’ sea-beat soil;<br />through air, unseen, involved in darkness glide,<br />and light on lectos, on the point of ide:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>presently they reached many-fountained ida, mother of wild</p>
    <p class=l>(mother of savages, whose echoing hills</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beasts, and lectum where they left the sea to go on by land, and</p>
    <p class=l>are heard resounding with a hundred rills:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the tops of the trees of the forest soughed under the going of</p>
    <p class=l>fair ida trembles underneath the god;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their feet.</p>
    <p class=l>hush’d are her mountains, and her forests nod.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>here sleep halted, and ere jove caught sight of him<br />he climbed a lofty pine-tree—the tallest that reared its head</p>
    <p class=l>there on a fir, whose spiry branches rise</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>towards heaven on all ida.</p>
    <p class=l>to join its summit to the neighbouring skies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he hid himself behind the branches and</p>
    <p class=l>dark in embowering shade, conceal’d from sight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sat there in the semblance of the sweet-singing bird that haunts</p>
    <p class=l>sat sleep, in likeness of the bird of night.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the mountains and is called chalcis by the gods, but men call it</p>
    <p class=l>(chalcis his name by those of heavenly birth,<br />but call’d cymindis by the race of earth.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cymindis.</p>
    <p class=l>)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>juno then went to gargarus, the topmost peak of ida,</p>
    <p class=l>to ida’s top successful juno flies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and jove, driver of the clouds, set eyes upon her.</p>
    <p class=l>great jove surveys her with desiring eyes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as soon as he</p>
    <p class=l>the god, whose lightning sets the heavens on fire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did so he became inflamed with the same passionate desire for her</p>
    <p class=l>through all his bosom feels the fierce desire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that he had felt when they had first enjoyed each other’s</p>
    <p class=l>fierce as when first by stealth he seized her charms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>embraces, and slept with one another without their dear parents</p>
    <p class=l>mix’d with her soul, and melted in her arms:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>knowing anything about it.</p>
    <p class=l>fix’d on her eyes he fed his eager look,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he went up to her and said, “what do</p>
    <p class=l>then press’d her hand, and thus with transport spoke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you want that you have come hither from olympus—and that too with</p>
    <p class=l>“why comes my goddess from the ethereal sky,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neither chariot nor horses to convey you?</p>
    <p class=l>and not her steeds and flaming chariot nigh?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then juno told him a lying tale and said, “i am going to the</p>
    <p class=l>then she—“i haste to those remote abodes</p>

    <p class=r>world’s end, to visit oceanus, from whom all we gods proceed, and</p>
    <p class=l>where the great parents of the deathless gods,<br />the reverend ocean and gray tethys, reign,<br />on the last limits of the land and main.</p>

    <p class=r>i was afraid you might be</p>
    <p class=l>nor seek, unknown to thee, the sacred cells</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>angry with me later on, if i went to the house of oceanus without</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>letting you know.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and jove said, “juno, you can choose some other time for paying</p>
    <p class=l>“for that (said jove) suffice another day!<br />but eager love denies the least delay.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your visit to oceanus—for the present let us devote ourselves to</p>

    <p class=r>and alcmena in thebes by whom i begot my lion-hearted son</p>

    <p class=r>juno again answered him with a lying tale.</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke; the goddess with the charming eyes<br />glows with celestial red, and thus replies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“most dread son of<br />saturn,” she exclaimed, “what are you talking about?</p>
    <p class=l>“is this a scene for love?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would you<br />have us enjoy one another here on the top of mount ida, where</p>
    <p class=l>on ida’s height,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>everything can be seen?</p>
    <p class=l>exposed to mortal and immortal sight!<br />our joys profaned by each familiar eye;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what if one of the ever-living gods</p>
    <p class=l>the sport of heaven, and fable of the sky:<br />how shall i e’er review the blest abodes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should see us sleeping together, and tell the others?</p>
    <p class=l>or mix among the senate of the gods?</p>

    <p class=r>it would be</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>such a scandal that when i had risen from your embraces i could<br />never show myself inside your house again; but if you are so</p>
    <p class=l>all heaven beholds me recent from thy arms?</p>

    <p class=l>with skill divine has vulcan form’d thy bower,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>has given it good strong doors; if you would so have it, let us</p>
    <p class=l>sacred to love and to the genial hour;<br />if such thy will, to that recess retire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>go thither and lie down.</p>

    <p class=r>and jove answered, “juno, you need not be afraid that either god</p>
    <p class=l>she ceased; and, smiling with superior love,<br />thus answer’d mild the cloud-compelling jove:</p>

    <p class=r>whereon the earth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, with</p>
    <p class=l>glad earth perceives, and from her bosom pours</p>

    <p class=l>and sudden hyacinths the turf bestrow,[237]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>themselves down and overhead they were covered by a fair cloud of</p>
    <p class=l>and flamy crocus made the mountain glow<br />there golden clouds conceal the heavenly pair,<br />steep’d in soft joys and circumfused with air;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gold, from which there fell glittering dew-drops.</p>
    <p class=l>celestial dews, descending o’er the ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on the</p>
    <p class=l>perfume the mount, and breathe ambrosia round:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>crest of ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held his</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spouse in his arms.</p>
    <p class=l>the panting thunderer nods, and sinks to rest.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile sleep made off to the ships of the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans, to tell earth-encircling neptune, lord of the</p>
    <p class=l>beside him sudden, unperceived, he stood,<br />and thus with gentle words address’d the god:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>earthquake.</p>
    <p class=l>“now, neptune!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had found him he said, “now, neptune, you can</p>
    <p class=l>now, the important hour employ,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>help the danaans with a will, and give them victory though it be</p>
    <p class=l>to check a while the haughty hopes of troy:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>only for a short time while jove is still sleeping.</p>
    <p class=l>while jove yet rests, while yet my vapours shed</p>

    <p class=r>i have sent</p>
    <p class=l>the golden vision round his sacred head;</p>

    <p class=r>him into a sweet slumber, and juno has beguiled him into going to</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind,</p>
    <p class=l>thus having said, the power of slumber flew,<br />on human lids to drop the balmy dew.<br />neptune, with zeal increased, renews his care,<br />and towering in the foremost ranks of war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>leaving neptune more eager than ever to help the danaans.</p>
    <p class=l>indignant thus—“oh once of martial fame!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>o greeks!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>darted forward among the first ranks and shouted saying,</p>
    <p class=l>if yet ye can deserve the name!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“argives, shall we let hector son of priam have the triumph of</p>
    <p class=l>this half-recover’d day shall troy obtain?</p>

    <p class=r>taking our ships and covering himself with glory?</p>
    <p class=l>shall hector thunder at your ships again?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this is what he</p>
    <p class=l>lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>says that he shall now do, seeing that achilles is still in</p>
    <p class=l>still he vaunts, and threats the fleet with fires,<br />while stern achilles in his wrath retires.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dudgeon at his ship; we shall get on very well without him if we</p>
    <p class=l>one hero’s loss too tamely you deplore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>keep each other in heart and stand by one another.</p>
    <p class=l>be still yourselves, and ye shall need no more.</p>

    <p class=r>now,</p>
    <p class=l>oh yet, if glory any bosom warms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, let us all do as i say.</p>
    <p class=l>brace on your firmest helms, and stand to arms:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us each take the best and</p>
    <p class=l>his strongest spear each valiant grecian wield,</p>

    <p class=r>largest shield we can lay hold of, put on our helmets, and sally</p>
    <p class=l>each valiant grecian seize his broadest shield;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forth with our longest spears in our hands; i will lead you on,</p>
    <p class=l>let to the weak the lighter arms belong,<br />the ponderous targe be wielded by the strong.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and hector son of priam, rage as he may, will not dare to hold<br />out against us.<br />if any good staunch soldier has only a small<br />shield, let him hand it over to a worse man, and take a larger</p>
    <p class=l>thus arm’d, not hector shall our presence stay;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one for himself.</p>
    <p class=l>myself, ye greeks!<br />myself will lead the way.</p>

    <p class=l>”<br />[illustration: ] greek shield</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said.</p>
    <p class=l>the troops assent; their martial arms they change:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of</p>
    <p class=l>the busy chiefs their banded legions range.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tydeus, ulysses, and agamemnon, wounded though they were, set the</p>
    <p class=l>the kings, though wounded, and oppress’d with pain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>others in array, and went about everywhere effecting the</p>
    <p class=l>with helpful hands themselves assist the train.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>exchanges of armour; the most valiant took the best armour, and</p>
    <p class=l>the strong and cumbrous arms the valiant wield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gave the worse to the worse man.</p>
    <p class=l>the weaker warrior takes a lighter shield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they had donned their<br />bronze armour they marched on with neptune at their head.<br />in his</p>
    <p class=l>thus sheath’d in shining brass, in bright array</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strong hand he grasped his terrible sword, keen of edge and</p>
    <p class=l>the legions march, and neptune leads the way:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flashing like lightning; woe to him who comes across it in the</p>
    <p class=l>his brandish’d falchion flames before their eyes,<br />like lightning flashing through the frighted skies.<br />clad in his might, the earth-shaking power appears;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>day of battle; all men quake for fear and keep away from it.</p>
    <p class=l>pale mortals tremble, and confess their fears.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector on the other side set the trojans in array.</p>
    <p class=l>troy’s great defender stands alone unawed,<br />arms his proud host, and dares oppose a god:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon</p>
    <p class=l>and lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neptune and hector waged fierce war on one another—hector on the</p>
    <p class=l>the god, and wondrous man, appear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojan and neptune on the argive side.</p>
    <p class=l>the sea’s stern ruler there, and hector here.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty was the uproar as</p>
    <p class=l>the roaring main, at her great master’s call,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the two forces met; the sea came rolling in towards the ships and</p>
    <p class=l>rose in huge ranks, and form’d a watery wall<br />around the ships: seas hanging o’er the shores,<br />both armies join: earth thunders, ocean roars.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tents of the achaeans, but waves do not thunder on the shore more</p>
    <p class=l>not half so loud the bellowing deeps resound,<br />when stormy winds disclose the dark profound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>loudly when driven before the blast of boreas, nor do the flames</p>
    <p class=l>less loud the winds that from the æolian hall</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of a forest fire roar more fiercely when it is well alight upon</p>
    <p class=l>roar through the woods, and make whole forests fall;<br />less loud the woods, when flames in torrents pour,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the mountains, nor does the wind bellow with ruder music as it</p>
    <p class=l>catch the dry mountain, and its shades devour;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tears on through the tops of when it is blowing its hardest, than<br />the terrible shout which the trojans and achaeans raised as they</p>
    <p class=l>with such a rage the meeting hosts are driven,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sprang upon one another.</p>
    <p class=l>and such a clamour shakes the sounding heaven.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector first aimed his spear at ajax, who was turned full towards</p>
    <p class=l>the first bold javelin, urged by hector’s force,<br />direct at ajax’ bosom winged its course;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him, nor did he miss his aim.</p>
    <p class=l>but there no pass the crossing belts afford,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the spear struck him where two<br />bands passed over his chest—the band of his shield and that of<br />his silver-studded sword—and these protected his body.</p>
    <p class=l>(one braced his shield, and one sustain’d his sword.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector was</p>
    <p class=l>)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>angry that his spear should have been hurled in vain, and</p>
    <p class=l>then back the disappointed trojan drew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>withdrew under cover of his men.</p>
    <p class=l>and cursed the lance that unavailing flew:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he was thus retreating, ajax</p>
    <p class=l>but ’scaped not ajax; his tempestuous hand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of telamon, struck him with a stone, of which there were many</p>
    <p class=l>a ponderous stone upheaving from the sand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lying about under the men’s feet as they fought—brought there to</p>
    <p class=l>(where heaps laid loose beneath the warrior’s feet,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>give support to the ships’ sides as they lay on the shore.</p>
    <p class=l>or served to ballast, or to prop the fleet,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax</p>
    <p class=l>toss’d round and round, the missive marble flings;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>caught up one of them and struck hector above the rim of his</p>
    <p class=l>on the razed shield the fallen ruin rings,<br />full on his breast and throat with force descends;<br />nor deaden’d there its giddy fury spends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shield close to his neck; the blow made him spin round like a top</p>
    <p class=l>but whirling on, with many a fiery round,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and reel in all directions.</p>
    <p class=l>smokes in the dust, and ploughs into the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as an oak falls headlong when</p>
    <p class=l>as when the bolt, red-hissing from above,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>uprooted by the lightning flash of father jove, and there is a</p>
    <p class=l>darts on the consecrated plant of jove,<br />the mountain-oak in flaming ruin lies,<br />black from the blow, and smokes of sulphur rise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>terrible smell of brimstone—no man can help being dismayed if he</p>
    <p class=l>stiff with amaze the pale beholders stand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is standing near it, for a thunderbolt is a very awful thing—even</p>
    <p class=l>and own the terrors of the almighty hand!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so did hector fall to earth and bite the dust.</p>
    <p class=l>so lies great hector prostrate on the shore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his spear fell</p>
    <p class=l>his slacken’d hand deserts the lance it bore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from his hand, but his shield and helmet were made fast about his</p>
    <p class=l>his following shield the fallen chief o’erspread;<br />beneath his helmet dropp’d his fainting head;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body, and his bronze armour rang about him.</p>
    <p class=l>his load of armour, sinking to the ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sons of the achaeans came running with a loud cry towards</p>
    <p class=l>clanks on the field, a dead and hollow sound.<br />loud shouts of triumph fill the crowded plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him, hoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on</p>
    <p class=l>greece sees, in hope, troy’s great defender slain:<br />all spring to seize him; storms of arrows fly,<br />and thicker javelins intercept the sky.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans, but none of them could wound him before he was</p>
    <p class=l>in vain an iron tempest hisses round;<br />he lies protected, and without a wound.<br />[238]</p>

    <p class=l>and each bold leader of the lycian band,</p>

    <p class=r>held their round shields over him to cover him.</p>

    <p class=l>his mournful followers, with assistant care,</p>

    <p class=l>with watery drops the chief they sprinkle round,</p>

    <p class=r>breathed again and opened his eyes.</p>
    <p class=l>placed on the margin of the flowery ground.</p>

    <p class=l>raised on his knees, he now ejects the gore;</p>

    <p class=r>were again closed in darkness for he was still stunned by the</p>

    <p class=r>blow.</p>
    <p class=l>and seals again, by fits, his swimming eyes.</p>

    <p class=l>as by his side the groaning warrior fell,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saved himself by swerving aside and the spear struck archelochus</p>
    <p class=l>at the fierce foe he launch’d his piercing steel;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of antenor, for heaven counselled his destruction; it struck</p>
    <p class=l>the foe, reclining, shunn’d the flying death;<br />but fate, archilochus, demands thy breath:<br />thy lofty birth no succour could impart,<br />the wings of death o’ertook thee on the dart;<br />swift to perform heaven’s fatal will, it fled</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>head, mouth, and nostrils reached the ground long before his legs</p>

    <p class=r>and knees could do so, and ajax shouted to polydamas saying,</p>

    <p class=r>“think, polydamas, and tell me truly whether this man is not as</p>
    <p class=l>say, is this chief extended on the plain</p>

    <p class=r>well worth killing as prothoenor was: he seems rich, and of rich</p>

    <p class=l>the bleeding youth: troy sadden’d at the view.</p>

    <p class=r>acamas then bestrode his brother’s body and wounded</p>
    <p class=l>but furious acamas avenged his cause;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>promachus the boeotian with his spear, for he was trying to drag<br />his brother’s body away.</p>
    <p class=l>as promachus his slaughtered brother draws,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>acamas vaunted loudly over him saying,</p>
    <p class=l>he pierced his heart—“such fate attends you all,</p>

    <p class=r>“argive archers, braggarts that you are, toil and suffering shall</p>

    <p class=l>a victim owed to my brave brother’s death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a man, therefore, may well be thankful if he leaves a kinsman in</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his house behind him to avenge his fall.</p>
    <p class=l>who leaves a brother to revenge his fate.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his taunts infuriated the argives, and peneleos was more enraged</p>
    <p class=l>heart-piercing anguish struck the grecian host,<br />but touch’d the breast of bold peneleus most;<br />at the proud boaster he directs his course;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>than any of them.</p>
    <p class=l>the boaster flies, and shuns superior force.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he sprang towards acamas, but acamas did not</p>
    <p class=l>but young ilioneus received the spear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stand his ground, and he killed ilioneus son of the rich</p>
    <p class=l>ilioneus, his father’s only care:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flock-master phorbas, whom mercury had favoured and endowed with<br />greater wealth than any other of the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>(phorbas the rich, of all the trojan train</p>

    <p class=l>whom hermes loved, and taught the arts of gain:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>only son, and peneleos now wounded him in the eye under his</p>
    <p class=l>full in his eye the weapon chanced to fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eyebrows, tearing the eye-ball from its socket: the spear went</p>
    <p class=l>and from the fibres scoop’d the rooted ball,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>right through the eye into the nape of the neck, and he fell,</p>
    <p class=l>drove through the neck, and hurl’d him to the plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stretching out both hands before him.</p>
    <p class=l>he lifts his miserable arms in vain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>peneleos then drew his</p>
    <p class=l>swift his broad falchion fierce peneleus spread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sword and smote him on the neck, so that both head and helmet</p>
    <p class=l>and from the spouting shoulders struck his head;<br />to earth at once the head and helmet fly;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came tumbling down to the ground with the spear still sticking in</p>
    <p class=l>the lance, yet sticking through the bleeding eye,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the eye; he then held up the head, as though it had been a</p>
    <p class=l>the victor seized; and, as aloft he shook</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>poppy-head, and showed it to the trojans, vaunting over them as</p>
    <p class=l>the gory visage, thus insulting spoke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he did so.</p>
    <p class=l>“trojans!<br />your great ilioneus behold!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“trojans,” he cried, “bid the father and mother of</p>
    <p class=l>haste, to his father let the tale be told:</p>

    <p class=l>then soon the haughty sea-god shall obey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like it or no, would soon come round to your and my way of<br />thinking.</p>
    <p class=l>nor dare to act but when we point the way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if, then, you are speaking the truth and mean what you</p>
    <p class=l>if truth inspires thy tongue, proclaim our will</p>

    <p class=r>say, go among the rank and file of the gods, and tell iris and</p>
    <p class=l>to yon bright synod on the olympian hill;<br />our high decree let various iris know,<br />and call the god that bears the silver bow.<br />let her descend, and from the embattled plain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaean host and tell neptune to leave off fighting and go</p>
    <p class=l>while phœbus hastes great hector to prepare</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>home, and apollo, that he may send hector again into battle and</p>
    <p class=l>to rise afresh, and once more wake the war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>give him fresh strength; he will thus forget his present</p>
    <p class=l>his labouring bosom re-inspires with breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sufferings, and drive the achaeans back in confusion till they</p>
    <p class=l>and calls his senses from the verge of death.</p>

    <p class=r>achilles will</p>
    <p class=l>he, not untouch’d with pity, to the plain</p>

    <p class=r>them my own noble son sarpedon.</p>
    <p class=l>even my loved son, divine sarpedon, falls!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles will kill hector to</p>

    <p class=l>then, nor till then, shall great achilles rise:<br />and lo!<br />that instant, godlike hector dies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans shall persistently drive the trojans back till they</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>promise i made by bowing my head on the day when thetis touched</p>
    <p class=l>the promise of a god</p>

    <p class=r>my knees and besought me to give him honour.</p>
    <p class=l>i gave, and seal’d it with the almighty nod,<br />achilles’ glory to the stars to raise;<br />such was our word, and fate the word obeys.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>juno heeded his words and went from the heights of ida to great</p>
    <p class=l>the trembling queen (the almighty order given)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>olympus.</p>
    <p class=l>swift from the idaean summit shot to heaven.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>swift as the thought of one whose fancy carries him over</p>
    <p class=l>as some wayfaring man, who wanders o’er<br />in thought a length of lands he trod before,<br />sends forth his active mind from place to place,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vast continents, and he says to himself, “now i will be here, or</p>
    <p class=l>joins hill to dale, and measures space with space:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there,” and he would have all manner of things—even so swiftly<br />did juno wing her way till she came to high olympus and went in</p>
    <p class=l>so swift flew juno to the bless’d abodes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among the gods who were gathered in the house of jove.</p>
    <p class=l>if thought of man can match the speed of gods.<br />there sat the powers in awful synod placed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they<br />saw her they all of them came up to her, and held out their cups<br />to her by way of greeting.<br />she let the others be, but took the<br />cup offered her by lovely themis, who was first to come running</p>
    <p class=l>they bow’d, and made obeisance as she pass’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>up to her.</p>
    <p class=l>through all the brazen dome:[239] with goblets crown’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“juno,” said she, “why are you here?</p>
    <p class=l>they hail her queen; the nectar streams around.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and you seem</p>
    <p class=l>fair themis first presents the golden bowl,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>troubled—has your husband the son of saturn been frightening</p>
    <p class=l>and anxious asks what cares disturb her soul?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you?<br />”<br />and juno answered, “themis, do not ask me about it.</p>
    <p class=l>to whom the white-arm’d goddess thus replies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you know what</p>
    <p class=l>“enough thou know’st the tyrant of the skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a proud and cruel disposition my husband has.</p>
    <p class=l>severely bent his purpose to fulfil,<br />unmoved his mind, and unrestrain’d his will.</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>bid the crown’d nectar circle round the hall:<br />but jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>designs which he has avowed.</p>
    <p class=l>such stern decrees, such threaten’d woes to come,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many a one, mortal and immortal,</p>
    <p class=l>as soon shall freeze mankind with dire surprise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will be angered by them, however peaceably he may be feasting</p>
    <p class=l>and damp the eternal banquets of the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this juno sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout the</p>
    <p class=l>the goddess said, and sullen took her place;<br />black horror sadden’d each celestial face.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>house of jove.</p>
    <p class=l>to see the gathering grudge in every breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>laughter sat on her lips but her brow was furrowed</p>
    <p class=l>smiles on her lips a spleenful joy express’d;<br />while on her wrinkled front, and eyebrow bent,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with care, and she spoke up in a rage.</p>
    <p class=l>sat stedfast care, and lowering discontent.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“fools that we are,” she</p>
    <p class=l>thus she proceeds—“attend, ye powers above!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cried, “to be thus madly angry with jove; we keep on wanting to</p>
    <p class=l>but know, ’tis madness to contest with jove:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>go up to him and stay him by force or by persuasion, but he sits</p>
    <p class=l>supreme he sits; and sees, in pride of sway.<br />your vassal godheads grudgingly obey:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aloof and cares for nobody, for he knows that he is much stronger</p>
    <p class=l>fierce in the majesty of power controls;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>than any other of the immortals.</p>
    <p class=l>shakes all the thrones of heaven, and bends the poles.<br />submiss, immortals!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>make the best, therefore, of</p>
    <p class=l>all he wills, obey:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whatever ills he may choose to send each one of you; mars, i take</p>
    <p class=l>and thou, great mars, begin and show the way.</p>

    <p class=r>it, has had a taste of them already, for his son ascalaphus has</p>
    <p class=l>behold ascalaphus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fallen in battle—the man whom of all others he loved most dearly</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and whose father he owns himself to be.</p>
    <p class=l>if that loved boasted offspring be thy own.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he heard this mars smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat</p>
    <p class=l>stern mars, with anguish for his slaughter’d son,<br />smote his rebelling breast, and fierce begun:<br />“thus then, immortals!<br />thus shall mars obey;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of his hands, and said in anger, “do not blame me, you gods that</p>
    <p class=l>forgive me, gods, and yield my vengeance way:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dwell in heaven, if i go to the ships of the achaeans and avenge</p>
    <p class=l>descending first to yon forbidden plain,<br />the god of battles dares avenge the slain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the death of my son, even though it end in my being struck by</p>
    <p class=l>dares, though the thunder bursting o’er my head</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove’s lightning and lying in blood and dust among the corpses.</p>
    <p class=l>should hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses panic and rout,</p>
    <p class=l>with that he gives command to fear and flight</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while he put on his armour.</p>
    <p class=l>to join his rapid coursers for the fight:<br />then grim in arms, with hasty vengeance flies;<br />arms that reflect a radiance through the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this, jove would have been roused</p>
    <p class=l>and now had jove, by bold rebellion driven,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to still more fierce and implacable enmity against the other</p>
    <p class=l>discharged his wrath on half the host of heaven;<br />but pallas, springing through the bright abode,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>immortals, had not minerva, alarmed for the safety of the gods,</p>
    <p class=l>starts from her azure throne to calm the god.<br />struck for the immortal race with timely fear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sprung from her seat and hurried outside.</p>
    <p class=l>from frantic mars she snatch’d the shield and spear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she tore the helmet<br />from his head and the shield from his shoulders, and she took the<br />bronze spear from his strong hand and set it on one side; then</p>
    <p class=l>then the huge helmet lifting from his head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she said to mars, “madman, you are undone; you have ears that</p>
    <p class=l>thus to the impetuous homicide she said:<br />“by what wild passion, furious!<br />art thou toss’d?<br />striv’st thou with jove?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hear not, or you have lost all judgement and understanding; have</p>
    <p class=l>thou art already lost.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you not heard what juno has said on coming straight from the</p>
    <p class=l>shall not the thunderer’s dread command restrain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>presence of olympian jove?</p>
    <p class=l>and was imperial juno heard in vain?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do you wish to go through all kinds of<br />suffering before you are brought back sick and sorry to olympus,</p>
    <p class=l>back to the skies wouldst thou with shame be driven,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after having caused infinite mischief to all us others?</p>
    <p class=l>and in thy guilt involve the host of heaven?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove</p>
    <p class=l>ilion and greece no more should jove engage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would instantly leave the trojans and achaeans to themselves; he<br />would come to olympus to punish us, and would grip us up one</p>
    <p class=l>the skies would yield an ampler scene of rage;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after another, guilty or not guilty.</p>
    <p class=l>guilty and guiltless find an equal fate</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore lay aside your</p>
    <p class=l>and one vast ruin whelm the olympian state.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>anger for the death of your son; better men than he have either</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>been killed already or will fall hereafter, and one cannot</p>
    <p class=l>heroes as great have died, and yet shall fall.<br />why should heaven’s law with foolish man comply</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>protect every one’s whole family.</p>
    <p class=l>exempted from the race ordain’d to die?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words she took mars back to his seat.</p>
    <p class=l>this menace fix’d the warrior to his throne;<br />sullen he sat, and curb’d the rising groan.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile juno</p>
    <p class=l>then juno call’d (jove’s orders to obey)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>called apollo outside, with iris the messenger of the gods.</p>
    <p class=l>the winged iris, and the god of day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“jove,” she said to them, “desires you to go to him at once on</p>
    <p class=l>“go wait the thunderer’s will (saturnia cried)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mt.</p>
    <p class=l>on yon tall summit of the fountful ide:</p>

    <p class=r>ida; when you have seen him you are to do as he may then bid</p>
    <p class=l>there in the father’s awful presence stand,<br />receive, and execute his dread command.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon juno left them and resumed her seat inside, while iris</p>
    <p class=l>she said, and sat; the god that gilds the day,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and apollo made all haste on their way.</p>
    <p class=l>and various iris, wing their airy way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they reached</p>
    <p class=l>swift as the wind, to ida’s hills they came,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many-fountained ida, mother of wild beasts, they found jove</p>
    <p class=l>(fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seated on topmost gargarus with a fragrant cloud encircling his</p>
    <p class=l>there sat the eternal; he whose nod controls</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>head as with a diadem.</p>
    <p class=l>the trembling world, and shakes the steady poles.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they stood before his presence, and he was</p>
    <p class=l>veil’d in a mist of fragrance him they found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pleased with them for having been so quick in obeying the orders</p>
    <p class=l>with clouds of gold and purple circled round.<br />well-pleased the thunderer saw their earnest care,<br />and prompt obedience to the queen of air;<br />then (while a smile serenes his awful brow)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his wife had given them.</p>
    <p class=l>commands the goddess of the showery bow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he spoke to iris first.</p>
    <p class=l>“iris!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“go,” said he, “fleet iris, tell king</p>
    <p class=l>descend, and what we here ordain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neptune what i now bid you—and tell him true.</p>
    <p class=l>report to yon mad tyrant of the main.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bid him leave off<br />fighting, and either join the company of the gods, or go down</p>
    <p class=l>bid him from fight to his own deeps repair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into the sea.</p>
    <p class=l>or breathe from slaughter in the fields of air.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if he takes no heed and disobeys me, let him<br />consider well whether he is strong enough to hold his own against<br />me if i attack him.</p>
    <p class=l>if he refuse, then let him timely weigh</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i am older and much stronger than he is; yet</p>
    <p class=l>our elder birthright, and superior sway.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he is not afraid to set himself up as on a level with myself, of</p>
    <p class=l>how shall his rashness stand the dire alarms,<br />if heaven’s omnipotence descend in arms?<br />strives he with me, by whom his power was given,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whom all the other gods stand in awe.</p>
    <p class=l>and is there equal to the lord of heaven?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>iris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, and as the cold hail or</p>
    <p class=l>the all-mighty spoke; the goddess wing’d her flight<br />to sacred ilion from the idaean height.<br />swift as the rattling hail, or fleecy snows,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>snow-flakes that fly from out the clouds before the blast of</p>
    <p class=l>drive through the skies, when boreas fiercely blows;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>boreas, even so did she wing her way till she came close up to</p>
    <p class=l>so from the clouds descending iris falls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the great shaker of the earth.<br />then she said, “i have come, o</p>
    <p class=l>and to blue neptune thus the goddess calls:</p>

    <p class=r>he bids you leave off fighting, and</p>
    <p class=l>he bids thee from forbidden wars repair</p>

    <p class=r>either join the company of the gods or go down into the sea; if,</p>
    <p class=l>to thine own deeps, or to the fields of air.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>however, you take no heed and disobey him, he says he will come</p>
    <p class=l>this if refused, he bids thee timely weigh</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>down here and fight you.</p>
    <p class=l>his elder birthright, and superior sway.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he would have you keep out of his reach,</p>
    <p class=l>how shall thy rashness stand the dire alarms</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for he is older and much stronger than you are, and yet you are</p>

    <p class=r>not afraid to set yourself up as on a level with himself, of whom</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neptune was very angry and said, “great heavens!</p>
    <p class=l>“what means the haughty sovereign of the skies?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strong as jove</p>

    <p class=r>neptune now left the field to go down under the sea, and sorely</p>
    <p class=l>thus speaking, furious from the field he strode,</p>

    <p class=l>and plunged into the bosom of the flood.<br />the lord of thunders, from his lofty height</p>

    <p class=r>then jove said to apollo, “go, dear</p>

    <p class=r>it is<br />better for both of us that he should have curbed his anger and</p>
    <p class=l>well was the crime, and well the vengeance spared;</p>

    <p class=l>” the godhead said;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo obeyed his father’s saying, and left the crests of ida,</p>
    <p class=l>his will divine the son of jove obey’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flying like a falcon, bane of doves and swiftest of all birds.</p>

    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>that drives a turtle through the liquid skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>found hector no longer lying upon the ground, but sitting up, for</p>
    <p class=l>as phœbus, shooting from the idaean brow,<br />glides down the mountain to the plain below.<br />there hector seated by the stream he sees,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he had just come to himself again.</p>
    <p class=l>his sense returning with the coming breeze;<br />again his pulses beat, his spirits rise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he knew those who were about</p>
    <p class=l>again his loved companions meet his eyes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him, and the sweat and hard breathing had left him from the</p>
    <p class=l>jove thinking of his pains, they pass’d away,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moment when the will of aegis-bearing jove had revived him.</p>
    <p class=l>to whom the god who gives the golden day:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo stood beside him and said, “hector son of priam, why are</p>
    <p class=l>“why sits great hector from the field so far?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you so faint, and why are you here away from the others?</p>
    <p class=l>what grief, what wound, withholds thee from the war?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>has any<br />mishap befallen you?<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector in a weak voice answered, “and which, kind sir, of the</p>
    <p class=l>the fainting hero, as the vision bright<br />stood shining o’er him, half unseal’d his sight:<br />“what blest immortal, with commanding breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gods are you, who now ask me thus?</p>
    <p class=l>thus wakens hector from the sleep of death?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do you not know that ajax</p>
    <p class=l>has fame not told, how, while my trusty sword</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>struck me on the chest with a stone as i was killing his comrades<br />at the ships of the achaeans, and compelled me to leave off</p>
    <p class=l>bathed greece in slaughter, and her battle gored,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fighting?</p>
    <p class=l>the mighty ajax with a deadly blow</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i made sure that this very day i should breathe my last</p>
    <p class=l>had almost sunk me to the shades below?<br />even yet, methinks, the gliding ghosts i spy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and go down into the house of hades.</p>
    <p class=l>and hell’s black horrors swim before my eye.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then king apollo said to him, “take heart; the son of saturn has</p>
    <p class=l>to him apollo: “be no more dismay’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sent you a mighty helper from ida to stand by you and defend you,</p>
    <p class=l>see, and be strong!<br />the thunderer sends thee aid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even me, phoebus apollo of the golden sword, who have been</p>
    <p class=l>behold!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>guardian hitherto not only of yourself but of your city.</p>
    <p class=l>thy phœbus shall his arms employ,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now,</p>
    <p class=l>phœbus, propitious still to thee and troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, order your horsemen to drive their chariots to the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships in great multitudes.</p>
    <p class=l>and to the ships impel thy rapid horse:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will go before your horses to smooth</p>
    <p class=l>even i will make thy fiery coursers way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the way for them, and will turn the achaeans in flight.</p>
    <p class=l>and drive the grecians headlong to the sea.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of his</p>
    <p class=l>thus to bold hector spoke the son of jove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>people.</p>
    <p class=l>and breathed immortal ardour from above.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and as a horse, stabled and full-fed, breaks loose and</p>
    <p class=l>as when the pamper’d steed, with reins unbound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gallops gloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont</p>
    <p class=l>breaks from his stall, and pours along the ground;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to take his bath in the river—he tosses his head, and his mane</p>
    <p class=l>with ample strokes he rushes to the flood,<br />to bathe his sides, and cool his fiery blood;<br />his head, now freed, he tosses to the skies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>streams over his shoulders as in all the pride of his strength he</p>
    <p class=l>his mane dishevell’d o’er his shoulders flies:<br />he snuffs the females in the well-known plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flies full speed to the pastures where the mares are feeding—even</p>
    <p class=l>and springs, exulting, to his fields again:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so hector, when he heard what the god said, urged his horsemen</p>
    <p class=l>urged by the voice divine, thus hector flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on, and sped forward as fast as his limbs could take him.</p>
    <p class=l>full of the god; and all his hosts pursue.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as</p>
    <p class=l>as when the force of men and dogs combined</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>country peasants set their hounds on to a homed stag or wild</p>
    <p class=l>invade the mountain goat, or branching hind;<br />far from the hunter’s rage secure they lie</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>goat—he has taken shelter under rock or thicket, and they cannot</p>
    <p class=l>close in the rock, (not fated yet to die)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>find him, but, lo, a bearded lion whom their shouts have roused</p>
    <p class=l>when lo!<br />a lion shoots across the way!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stands in their path, and they are in no further humour for the</p>
    <p class=l>they fly: at once the chasers and the prey.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chase—even so the achaeans were still charging on in a body,</p>
    <p class=l>so greece, that late in conquering troops pursued,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>using their swords and spears pointed at both ends, but when they</p>
    <p class=l>and mark’d their progress through the ranks in blood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saw hector going about among his men they were afraid, and their</p>
    <p class=l>soon as they see the furious chief appear,<br />forget to vanquish, and consent to fear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hearts fell down into their feet.</p>
    <p class=l>thoas with grief observed his dreadful course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then spoke thoas son of andraemon, leader of the aetolians, a man</p>
    <p class=l>thoas, the bravest of the ætolian force;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who could throw a good throw, and who was staunch also in close</p>
    <p class=l>skill’d to direct the javelin’s distant flight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight, while few could surpass him in debate when opinions were</p>
    <p class=l>and bold to combat in the standing fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>divided.</p>
    <p class=l>not more in councils famed for solid sense,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them</p>
    <p class=l>than winning words and heavenly eloquence.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus: “what, in heaven’s name, do i now see?</p>
    <p class=l>“gods!<br />what portent (he cried) these eyes invades?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is it not hector</p>
    <p class=l>lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come to life again?</p>
    <p class=l>hector rises from the stygian shades!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>every one made sure he had been killed by</p>
    <p class=l>we saw him, late, by thundering ajax kill’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax son of telamon, but it seems that one of the gods has again<br />rescued him.</p>
    <p class=l>what god restores him to the frighted field;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he has killed many of us danaans already, and i take</p>
    <p class=l>and not content that half of greece lie slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it will yet do so, for the hand of jove must be with him or he</p>
    <p class=l>pours new destruction on her sons again?<br />he comes not, jove!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would never dare show himself so masterful in the forefront of</p>
    <p class=l>without thy powerful will;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the battle.</p>
    <p class=l>lo!<br />still he lives, pursues, and conquers still!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, therefore, let us all do as i say; let us order</p>
    <p class=l>yet hear my counsel, and his worst withstand:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the main body of our forces to fall back upon the ships, but let</p>
    <p class=l>the greeks’ main body to the fleet command;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>those of us who profess to be the flower of the army stand firm,</p>
    <p class=l>but let the few whom brisker spirits warm,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and see whether we cannot hold hector back at the point of our</p>
    <p class=l>stand the first onset, and provoke the storm.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spears as soon as he comes near us; i conceive that he will then</p>
    <p class=l>thus point your arms; and when such foes appear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>think better of it before he tries to charge into the press of</p>
    <p class=l>fierce as he is, let hector learn to fear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the danaans.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said.</p>
    <p class=l>the warrior spoke; the listening greeks obey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>those who</p>
    <p class=l>thickening their ranks, and form a deep array.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were about ajax and king idomeneus, the followers moreover of</p>
    <p class=l>each ajax, teucer, merion gave command,<br />the valiant leader of the cretan band;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>teucer, meriones, and meges peer of mars called all their best</p>
    <p class=l>and mars-like meges: these the chiefs excite,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men about them and sustained the fight against hector and the</p>
    <p class=l>approach the foe, and meet the coming fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans, but the main body fell back upon the ships of the</p>
    <p class=l>behind, unnumber’d multitudes attend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>to flank the navy, and the shores defend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with hector striding</p>
    <p class=l>full on the front the pressing trojans bear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on at their head.</p>
    <p class=l>and hector first came towering to the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>before him went phoebus apollo shrouded in</p>
    <p class=l>phœbus himself the rushing battle led;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cloud about his shoulders.</p>
    <p class=l>a veil of clouds involved his radiant head:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he bore aloft the terrible aegis with</p>
    <p class=l>high held before him, jove’s enormous shield</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>its shaggy fringe, which vulcan the smith had given jove to</p>
    <p class=l>portentous shone, and shaded all the field;<br />vulcan to jove the immortal gift consign’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strike terror into the hearts of men.<br />with this in his hand he</p>
    <p class=l>to scatter hosts and terrify mankind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>led on the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>the greeks expect the shock, the clamours rise</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the argives held together and stood their ground.</p>
    <p class=l>from different parts, and mingle in the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the cry of</p>
    <p class=l>dire was the hiss of darts, by heroes flung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battle rose high from either side, and the arrows flew from the<br />bowstrings.<br />many a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in</p>
    <p class=l>and arrows leaping from the bow-string sung;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the bodies of many a valiant warrior, while others fell to earth</p>
    <p class=l>these drink the life of generous warriors slain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>midway, before they could taste of man’s fair flesh and glut<br />themselves with blood.</p>
    <p class=l>those guiltless fall, and thirst for blood in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so long as phoebus apollo held his aegis</p>
    <p class=l>as long as phœbus bore unmoved the shield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quietly and without shaking it, the weapons on either side took</p>
    <p class=l>sat doubtful conquest hovering o’er the field;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>effect and the people fell, but when he shook it straight in the</p>
    <p class=l>but when aloft he shakes it in the skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>face of the danaans and raised his mighty battle-cry their hearts</p>
    <p class=l>shouts in their ears, and lightens in their eyes,<br />deep horror seizes every grecian breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fainted within them and they forgot their former prowess.</p>
    <p class=l>their force is humbled, and their fear confess’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when</p>
    <p class=l>so flies a herd of oxen, scatter’d wide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two wild beasts spring in the dead of night on a herd of cattle</p>
    <p class=l>no swain to guard them, and no day to guide,<br />when two fell lions from the mountain come,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or a large flock of sheep when the herdsman is not there—even so</p>
    <p class=l>and spread the carnage through the shady gloom.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were the danaans struck helpless, for apollo filled them with</p>
    <p class=l>impending phœbus pours around them fear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>panic and gave victory to hector and the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>and troy and hector thunder in the rear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fight then became more scattered and they killed one another</p>
    <p class=l>heaps fall on heaps: the slaughter hector leads,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>where they best could.</p>
    <p class=l>first great arcesilas, then stichius bleeds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector killed stichius and arcesilaus, the</p>
    <p class=l>one to the bold bœotians ever dear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one, leader of the boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade</p>
    <p class=l>and one menestheus’ friend and famed compeer.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of menestheus.</p>
    <p class=l>medon and iasus, æneas sped;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas killed medon and iasus.</p>
    <p class=l>this sprang from phelus, and the athenians led;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the first was</p>
    <p class=l>but hapless medon from oïleus came;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bastard son to oileus, and brother to ajax, but he lived in</p>
    <p class=l>him ajax honour’d with a brother’s name,<br />though born of lawless love: from home expell’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>phylace away from his own country, for he had killed a man, a</p>
    <p class=l>a banish’d man, in phylacè he dwell’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>kinsman of his stepmother eriopis whom oileus had married.<br />iasus</p>
    <p class=l>press’d by the vengeance of an angry wife;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had become a leader of the athenians, and was son of sphelus the</p>
    <p class=l>troy ends at last his labours and his life.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of boucolos.<br />polydamas killed mecisteus, and polites echius,</p>
    <p class=l>mecystes next polydamas o’erthrew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the front of the battle, while agenor slew clonius.</p>
    <p class=l>and thee, brave clonius, great agenor slew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>paris</p>
    <p class=l>by paris, deiochus inglorious dies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>struck deiochus from behind in the lower part of the shoulder, as<br />he was flying among the foremost, and the point of the spear went<br />clean through him.</p>
    <p class=l>pierced through the shoulder as he basely flies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while they were spoiling these heroes of their armour, the</p>
    <p class=l>polites’ arm laid echius on the plain;<br />stretch’d on one heap, the victors spoil the slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans were flying pell-mell to the trench and the set stakes,</p>
    <p class=l>the greeks dismay’d, confused, disperse or fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and were forced back within their wall.</p>
    <p class=l>some seek the trench, some skulk behind the wall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector then cried out to</p>
    <p class=l>while these fly trembling, others pant for breath,<br />and o’er the slaughter stalks gigantic death.<br />on rush’d bold hector, gloomy as the night;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans, “forward to the ships, and let the spoils be.</p>
    <p class=l>forbids to plunder, animates the fight,<br />points to the fleet: “for, by the gods!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if i</p>
    <p class=l>who flies,[240]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see any man keeping back on the other side the wall away from the</p>
    <p class=l>who dares but linger, by this hand he dies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships i will have him killed: his kinsmen and kinswomen shall not</p>
    <p class=l>no weeping sister his cold eye shall close,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>give him his dues of fire, but dogs shall tear him in pieces in</p>
    <p class=l>no friendly hand his funeral pyre compose.<br />who stops to plunder at this signal hour,<br />the birds shall tear him, and the dogs devour.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>front of our city.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he laid his whip about his horses’ shoulders and</p>
    <p class=l>furious he said; the smarting scourge resounds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>called to the trojans throughout their ranks; the trojans shouted</p>
    <p class=l>the coursers fly; the smoking chariot bounds;<br />the hosts rush on; loud clamours shake the shore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with a cry that rent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck<br />with his own.</p>
    <p class=l>the horses thunder, earth and ocean roar!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>phoebus apollo went before, and kicked down the</p>
    <p class=l>apollo, planted at the trench’s bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>banks of the deep trench into its middle so as to make a great</p>
    <p class=l>push’d at the bank: down sank the enormous mound:<br />roll’d in the ditch the heapy ruin lay;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>broad bridge, as broad as the throw of a spear when a man is</p>
    <p class=l>a sudden road!<br />a long and ample way.<br />o’er the dread fosse (a late impervious space)<br />now steeds, and men, and cars tumultuous pass.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trying his strength.</p>
    <p class=l>the wondering crowds the downward level trod;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojan battalions poured over the</p>
    <p class=l>before them flamed the shield, and march’d the god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bridge, and apollo with his redoubtable aegis led the way.</p>
    <p class=l>then with his hand he shook the mighty wall;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>and lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>kicked down the wall of the achaeans as easily as a child who</p>
    <p class=l>the turrets nod, the bulwarks fall:<br />easy as when ashore an infant stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>playing on the sea-shore has built a house of sand and then kicks</p>
    <p class=l>and draws imagined houses in the sands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it down again and destroys it—even so did you, o apollo, shed</p>
    <p class=l>the sportive wanton, pleased with some new play,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>toil and trouble upon the argives, filling them with panic and</p>
    <p class=l>sweeps the slight works and fashion’d domes away:<br />thus vanish’d at thy touch, the towers and walls;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>confusion.</p>
    <p class=l>the toil of thousands in a moment falls.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus then were the achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out</p>
    <p class=l>the grecians gaze around with wild despair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to one another and raising their hands with loud cries every man</p>
    <p class=l>confused, and weary all the powers with prayer:<br />exhort their men, with praises, threats, commands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to heaven.</p>
    <p class=l>and urge the gods, with voices, eyes, and hands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nestor of gerene, tower of strength to the achaeans,</p>
    <p class=l>experienced nestor chief obtests the skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lifted up his hands to the starry firmament of heaven, and prayed</p>
    <p class=l>and weeps his country with a father’s eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>more fervently than any of them.</p>
    <p class=l>“o jove!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“father jove,” said he, “if ever</p>
    <p class=l>if ever, on his native shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>any one in wheat-growing argos burned you fat thigh-bones of</p>
    <p class=l>one greek enrich’d thy shrine with offer’d gore;<br />if e’er, in hope our country to behold,<br />we paid the fattest firstlings of the fold;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sheep or heifer and prayed that he might return safely home,</p>
    <p class=l>if e’er thou sign’st our wishes with thy nod:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whereon you bowed your head to him in assent, bear it in mind</p>
    <p class=l>perform the promise of a gracious god!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, and suffer not the trojans to triumph thus over the</p>
    <p class=l>this day preserve our navies from the flame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>and save the relics of the grecian name.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all-counselling jove thundered loudly in answer to the prayer of</p>
    <p class=l>thus prayed the sage: the eternal gave consent,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the aged son of neleus.</p>
    <p class=l>and peals of thunder shook the firmament.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they heard jove thunder they flung</p>
    <p class=l>presumptuous troy mistook the accepting sign,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>themselves yet more fiercely on the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>and catch’d new fury at the voice divine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as a wave breaking</p>
    <p class=l>as, when black tempests mix the seas and skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over the bulwarks of a ship when the sea runs high before a</p>
    <p class=l>the roaring deeps in watery mountains rise,<br />above the sides of some tall ship ascend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gale—for it is the force of the wind that makes the waves so</p>
    <p class=l>its womb they deluge, and its ribs they rend:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great—even so did the trojans spring over the wall with a shout,</p>
    <p class=l>thus loudly roaring, and o’erpowering all,<br />mount the thick trojans up the grecian wall;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and drive their chariots onwards.<br />the two sides fought with their</p>
    <p class=l>legions on legions from each side arise:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>double-pointed spears in hand-to-hand encounter-the trojans from</p>
    <p class=l>thick sound the keels; the storm of arrows flies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their chariots, and the achaeans climbing up into their ships and</p>
    <p class=l>fierce on the ships above, the cars below,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wielding the long pikes that were lying on the decks ready for<br />use in a sea-fight, jointed and shod with bronze.</p>
    <p class=l>these wield the mace, and those the javelin throw.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now patroclus, so long as the achaeans and trojans were fighting</p>
    <p class=l>while thus the thunder of the battle raged,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about the wall, but were not yet within it and at the ships,</p>
    <p class=l>and labouring armies round the works engaged,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>remained sitting in the tent of good eurypylus, entertaining him</p>
    <p class=l>still in the tent patroclus sat to tend<br />the good eurypylus, his wounded friend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with his conversation and spreading herbs over his wound to ease</p>
    <p class=l>he sprinkles healing balms, to anguish kind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his pain.</p>
    <p class=l>and adds discourse, the medicine of the mind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when, however, he saw the trojans swarming through the</p>
    <p class=l>but when he saw, ascending up the fleet,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>breach in the wall, while the achaeans were clamouring and struck</p>
    <p class=l>victorious troy; then, starting from his seat,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with panic, he cried aloud, and smote his two thighs with the</p>
    <p class=l>with bitter groans his sorrows he express’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flat of his hands.</p>
    <p class=l>he wrings his hands, he beats his manly breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“eurypylus,” said he in his dismay, “i know</p>
    <p class=l>“though yet thy state require redress (he cries)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you want me badly, but i cannot stay with you any longer, for</p>
    <p class=l>depart i must: what horrors strike my eyes!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there is hard fighting going on; a servant shall take care of you</p>
    <p class=l>charged with achilles’ high command i go,<br />a mournful witness of this scene of woe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, for i must make all speed to achilles, and induce him to</p>
    <p class=l>i haste to urge him by his country’s care</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight if i can; who knows but with heaven’s help i may persuade</p>
    <p class=l>to rise in arms, and shine again in war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him.</p>
    <p class=l>perhaps some favouring god his soul may bend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a man does well to listen to the advice of a friend.</p>
    <p class=l>the voice is powerful of a faithful friend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had thus spoken he went his way.</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke; and, speaking, swifter than the wind</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans stood firm</p>
    <p class=l>sprung from the tent, and left the war behind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and resisted the attack of the trojans, yet though these were</p>
    <p class=l>the embodied greeks the fierce attack sustain,<br />but strive, though numerous, to repulse in vain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fewer in number, they could not drive them back from the ships,<br />neither could the trojans break the achaean ranks and make their</p>
    <p class=l>nor could the trojans, through that firm array,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>way in among the tents and ships.</p>
    <p class=l>force to the fleet and tents the impervious way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as a carpenter’s line gives a</p>
    <p class=l>as when a shipwright, with palladian art,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>true edge to a piece of ship’s timber, in the hand of some</p>
    <p class=l>smooths the rough wood, and levels every part;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>skilled workman whom minerva has instructed in all kinds of</p>
    <p class=l>with equal hand he guides his whole design,<br />by the just rule, and the directing line:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>useful arts—even so level was the issue of the fight between the</p>
    <p class=l>the martial leaders, with like skill and care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two sides, as they fought some round one and some round another.</p>
    <p class=l>preserved their line, and equal kept the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector made straight for ajax, and the two fought fiercely about</p>
    <p class=l>brave deeds of arms through all the ranks were tried,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the same ship.</p>
    <p class=l>and every ship sustained an equal tide.<br />at one proud bark, high-towering o’er the fleet,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector could not force ajax back and fire the</p>
    <p class=l>ajax the great, and godlike hector meet;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ship, nor yet could ajax drive hector from the spot to which</p>
    <p class=l>for one bright prize the matchless chiefs contend,<br />nor this the ships can fire, nor that defend:<br />one kept the shore, and one the vessel trod;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heaven had brought him.</p>
    <p class=l>that fix’d as fate, this acted by a god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then ajax struck caletor son of clytius in the chest with a spear</p>
    <p class=l>the son of clytius in his daring hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he was bringing fire towards the ship.</p>
    <p class=l>the deck approaching, shakes a flaming brand;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he fell heavily to the</p>
    <p class=l>but, pierced by telamon’s huge lance, expires:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ground and the torch dropped from his hand.</p>
    <p class=l>thundering he falls, and drops the extinguish’d fires.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when hector saw his</p>
    <p class=l>great hector view’d him with a sad survey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cousin fallen in front of the ship he shouted to the trojans and</p>
    <p class=l>as stretch’d in dust before the stern he lay.<br />“oh!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lycians saying, “trojans, lycians, and dardanians good in close</p>
    <p class=l>all of trojan, all of lycian race!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight, bate not a jot, but rescue the son of clytius lest the</p>
    <p class=l>stand to your arms, maintain this arduous space:<br />lo!<br />where the son of royal clytius lies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans strip him of his armour now that he has fallen.</p>
    <p class=l>ah, save his arms, secure his obsequies!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then aimed a spear at ajax, and missed him, but he hit</p>
    <p class=l>this said, his eager javelin sought the foe:<br />but ajax shunn’d the meditated blow.<br />not vainly yet the forceful lance was thrown;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lycophron a follower of ajax, who came from cythera, but was</p>
    <p class=l>it stretch’d in dust unhappy lycophron:<br />an exile long, sustain’d at ajax’ board,<br />a faithful servant to a foreign lord;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>living with ajax inasmuch as he had killed a man among the</p>
    <p class=l>in peace, and war, for ever at his side,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cythereans.</p>
    <p class=l>near his loved master, as he lived, he died.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector’s spear struck him on the head below the ear,</p>
    <p class=l>from the high poop he tumbles on the sand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and he fell headlong from the ship’s prow on to the ground with<br />no life left in him.</p>
    <p class=l>and lies a lifeless load along the land.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax shook with rage and said to his</p>
    <p class=l>with anguish ajax views the piercing sight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brother, “teucer, my good fellow, our trusty comrade the son of</p>
    <p class=l>and thus inflames his brother to the fight:<br />“teucer, behold!<br />extended on the shore<br />our friend, our loved companion!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mastor has fallen, he came to live with us from cythera and whom</p>
    <p class=l>now no more!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we honoured as much as our own parents.</p>
    <p class=l>dear as a parent, with a parent’s care<br />to fight our wars he left his native air.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector has just killed</p>
    <p class=l>this death deplored, to hector’s rage we owe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him; fetch your deadly arrows at once and the bow which phoebus</p>
    <p class=l>revenge, revenge it on the cruel foe.<br />where are those darts on which the fates attend?<br />and where the bow which phœbus taught to bend?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo gave you.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>teucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver</p>
    <p class=l>impatient teucer, hastening to his aid,<br />before the chief his ample bow display’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in his hands.</p>
    <p class=l>the well-stored quiver on his shoulders hung:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forthwith he showered his arrows on the trojans,</p>
    <p class=l>then hiss’d his arrow, and the bowstring sung.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and hit cleitus the son of pisenor, comrade of polydamas the</p>
    <p class=l>clytus, pisenor’s son, renown’d in fame,<br />(to thee, polydamas!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>noble son of panthous, with the reins in his hands as he was</p>
    <p class=l>an honour’d name)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>attending to his horses; he was in the middle of the very</p>
    <p class=l>drove through the thickest of the embattled plains</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thickest part of the fight, doing good service to hector and the</p>
    <p class=l>the startling steeds, and shook his eager reins.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans, but evil had now come upon him, and not one of those who</p>
    <p class=l>as all on glory ran his ardent mind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were fain to do so could avert it, for the arrow struck him on</p>
    <p class=l>the pointed death arrests him from behind:<br />through his fair neck the thrilling arrow flies;<br />in youth’s first bloom reluctantly he dies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the back of the neck.</p>
    <p class=l>hurl’d from the lofty seat, at distance far,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he fell from his chariot and his horses<br />shook the empty car as they swerved aside.</p>
    <p class=l>the headlong coursers spurn his empty car;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>king polydamas saw</p>
    <p class=l>till sad polydamas the steeds restrain’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what had happened, and was the first to come up to the horses; he<br />gave them in charge to astynous son of protiaon, and ordered him<br />to look on, and to keep the horses near at hand.</p>
    <p class=l>and gave, astynous, to thy careful hand;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then went</p>
    <p class=l>then, fired to vengeance, rush’d amidst the foe:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>back and took his place in the front ranks.</p>
    <p class=l>rage edged his sword, and strengthen’d every blow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>teucer then aimed another arrow at hector, and there would have</p>
    <p class=l>once more bold teucer, in his country’s cause,<br />at hector’s breast a chosen arrow draws:<br />and had the weapon found the destined way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>been no more fighting at the ships if he had hit him and killed</p>
    <p class=l>thy fall, great trojan!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him then and there: jove, however, who kept watch over hector,</p>
    <p class=l>had renown’d that day.<br />but hector was not doom’d to perish then:<br />the all-wise disposer of the fates of men<br />(imperial jove) his present death withstands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had his eyes on teucer, and deprived him of his triumph, by</p>
    <p class=l>nor was such glory due to teucer’s hands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>breaking his bowstring for him just as he was drawing it and</p>
    <p class=l>at its full stretch as the tough string he drew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about to take his aim; on this the arrow went astray and the bow</p>
    <p class=l>struck by an arm unseen, it burst in two;<br />down dropp’d the bow: the shaft with brazen head</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fell from his hands.</p>
    <p class=l>fell innocent, and on the dust lay dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>teucer shook with anger and said to his</p>
    <p class=l>the astonish’d archer to great ajax cries;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brother, “alas, see how heaven thwarts us in all we do; it has</p>
    <p class=l>“some god prevents our destined enterprise:<br />some god, propitious to the trojan foe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>broken my bowstring and snatched the bow from my hand, though i</p>
    <p class=l>has, from my arm unfailing, struck the bow,<br />and broke the nerve my hands had twined with art,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strung it this self-same morning that it might serve me for many</p>
    <p class=l>strong to impel the flight of many a dart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>an arrow.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax son of telamon answered, “my good fellow, let your bow and</p>
    <p class=l>“since heaven commands it (ajax made reply)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your arrows be, for jove has made them useless in order to spite</p>
    <p class=l>dismiss the bow, and lay thy arrows by:<br />thy arms no less suffice the lance to wield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the danaans.</p>
    <p class=l>and quit the quiver for the ponderous shield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>take your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder,</p>
    <p class=l>in the first ranks indulge thy thirst of fame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and both fight the trojans yourself and urge others to do so.</p>
    <p class=l>thy brave example shall the rest inflame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they may be successful for the moment but if we fight as we ought</p>
    <p class=l>fierce as they are, by long successes vain;<br />to force our fleet, or even a ship to gain,<br />asks toil, and sweat, and blood: their utmost might</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they will find it a hard matter to take the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>shall find its match—no more: ’tis ours to fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>teucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent.</p>
    <p class=l>then teucer laid his faithless bow aside;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he hung a<br />shield four hides thick about his shoulders, and on his comely</p>
    <p class=l>the fourfold buckler o’er his shoulder tied;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>head he set his helmet well wrought with a crest of horse-hair</p>
    <p class=l>on his brave head a crested helm he placed,<br />with nodding horse-hair formidably graced;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that nodded menacingly above it; he grasped his redoubtable</p>
    <p class=l>a dart, whose point with brass refulgent shines,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bronze-shod spear, and forthwith he was by the side of ajax.</p>
    <p class=l>the warrior wields; and his great brother joins.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when hector saw that teucer’s bow was of no more use to him, he</p>
    <p class=l>this hector saw, and thus express’d his joy:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shouted out to the trojans and lycians, “trojans, lycians, and</p>
    <p class=l>“ye troops of lycia, dardanus, and troy!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dardanians good in close fight, be men, my friends, and show your</p>
    <p class=l>be mindful of yourselves, your ancient fame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mettle here at the ships, for i see the weapon of one of their</p>
    <p class=l>and spread your glory with the navy’s flame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chieftains made useless by the hand of jove.</p>
    <p class=l>jove is with us; i saw his hand, but now,<br />from the proud archer strike his vaunted bow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it is easy to see</p>
    <p class=l>indulgent jove!<br />how plain thy favours shine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when jove is helping people and means to help them still further,</p>
    <p class=l>when happy nations bear the marks divine!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or again when he is bringing them down and will do nothing for</p>
    <p class=l>how easy then, to see the sinking state</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them; he is now on our side, and is going against the argives.</p>
    <p class=l>of realms accursed, deserted, reprobate!<br />such is the fate of greece, and such is ours:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore swarm round the ships and fight.<br />if any of you is</p>
    <p class=l>behold, ye warriors, and exert your powers.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>struck by spear or sword and loses his life, let him die; he dies</p>
    <p class=l>death is the worst; a fate which all must try;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with honour who dies fighting for his country; and he will leave</p>
    <p class=l>and for our country, ’tis a bliss to die.<br />the gallant man, though slain in fight he be,<br />yet leaves his nation safe, his children free;<br />entails a debt on all the grateful state;<br />his own brave friends shall glory in his fate;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his wife and children safe behind him, with his house and<br />allotment unplundered if only the achaeans can be driven back to</p>
    <p class=l>his wife live honour’d, all his race succeed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their own land, they and their ships.</p>
    <p class=l>and late posterity enjoy the deed!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he put heart and soul into them all.</p>
    <p class=l>this roused the soul in every trojan breast:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax on the</p>
    <p class=l>the godlike ajax next his greeks address’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>other side exhorted his comrades saying, “shame on you argives,</p>
    <p class=l>“how long, ye warriors of the argive race,<br />(to generous argos what a dire disgrace!<br />)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we are now utterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by</p>
    <p class=l>how long on these cursed confines will ye lie,<br />yet undetermined, or to live or die?<br />what hopes remain, what methods to retire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>driving the enemy from our ships.</p>
    <p class=l>if once your vessels catch the trojan fire?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do you think, if hector takes</p>
    <p class=l>mark how the flames approach, how near they fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them, that you will be able to get home by land?</p>
    <p class=l>how hector calls, and troy obeys his call!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can you not hear</p>
    <p class=l>not to the dance that dreadful voice invites,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him cheering on his whole host to fire our fleet, and bidding</p>
    <p class=l>it calls to death, and all the rage of fights.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them remember that they are not at a dance but in battle?</p>
    <p class=l>’tis now no time for wisdom or debates;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>our</p>
    <p class=l>to your own hands are trusted all your fates;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>only course is to fight them with might and main; we had better</p>
    <p class=l>and better far in one decisive strife,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chance it, life or death, once for all, than fight long and</p>
    <p class=l>one day should end our labour or our life,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>without issue hemmed in at our ships by worse men than</p>
    <p class=l>than keep this hard-got inch of barren sands,<br />still press’d, and press’d by such inglorious hands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ourselves.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he put life and soul into them all.</p>
    <p class=l>the listening grecians feel their leader’s flame,<br />and every kindling bosom pants for fame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector then</p>
    <p class=l>then mutual slaughters spread on either side;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>killed schedius son of perimedes, leader of the phoceans, and</p>
    <p class=l>by hector here the phocian schedius died;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax killed laodamas captain of foot soldiers and son to antenor.</p>
    <p class=l>there, pierced by ajax, sunk laodamas,<br />chief of the foot, of old antenor’s race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>polydamas killed otus of cyllene a comrade of the son of phyleus</p>
    <p class=l>polydamas laid otus on the sand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and chief of the proud epeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the fierce commander of the epeian band.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when meges saw this he sprang upon</p>
    <p class=l>his lance bold meges at the victor threw;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him, but polydamas crouched down, and he missed him, for apollo</p>
    <p class=l>the victor, stooping, from the death withdrew;<br />(that valued life, o phœbus!<br />was thy care)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would not suffer the son of panthous to fall in battle; but the</p>
    <p class=l>but croesmus’ bosom took the flying spear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear hit croesmus in the middle of his chest, whereon he fell</p>
    <p class=l>his corpse fell bleeding on the slippery shore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heavily to the ground, and meges stripped him of his armour.</p>
    <p class=l>his radiant arms triumphant meges bore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at<br />that moment the valiant soldier dolops son of lampus sprang upon<br />lampus was son of laomedon and noted for his valour, while his</p>
    <p class=l>dolops, the son of lampus, rushes on,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son dolops was versed in all the ways of war.</p>
    <p class=l>sprung from the race of old laomedon,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then struck the</p>
    <p class=l>and famed for prowess in a well-fought field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>middle of the son of phyleus’ shield with his spear, setting on</p>
    <p class=l>he pierced the centre of his sounding shield:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him at close quarters, but his good corslet made with plates of</p>
    <p class=l>but meges, phyleus’ ample breastplate wore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>metal saved him; phyleus had brought it from ephyra and the river</p>
    <p class=l>(well-known in fight on sellè’s winding shore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>selleis, where his host, king euphetes, had given it him to wear</p>
    <p class=l>for king euphetes gave the golden mail,<br />compact, and firm with many a jointed scale)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in battle and protect him.</p>
    <p class=l>which oft, in cities storm’d, and battles won,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it now served to save the life of his<br />son.</p>
    <p class=l>had saved the father, and now saves the son.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then meges struck the topmost crest of dolops’s bronze</p>
    <p class=l>full at the trojan’s head he urged his lance,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>helmet with his spear and tore away its plume of horse-hair, so</p>
    <p class=l>where the high plumes above the helmet dance,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that all newly dyed with scarlet as it was it tumbled down into</p>
    <p class=l>new ting’d with tyrian dye: in dust below,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the dust.</p>
    <p class=l>shorn from the crest, the purple honours glow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while he was still fighting and confident of victory,</p>
    <p class=l>meantime their fight the spartan king survey’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus came up to help meges, and got by the side of dolops</p>
    <p class=l>and stood by meges’ side a sudden aid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder, from behind,</p>
    <p class=l>through dolops’ shoulder urged his forceful dart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and the point, driven so furiously, went through into his chest,</p>
    <p class=l>which held its passage through the panting heart,<br />and issued at his breast.<br />with thundering sound</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whereon he fell headlong.</p>
    <p class=l>the warrior falls, extended on the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the two then made towards him to strip</p>
    <p class=l>in rush the conquering greeks to spoil the slain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him of his armour, but hector called on all his brothers for</p>
    <p class=l>but hector’s voice excites his kindred train;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>help, and he especially upbraided brave melanippus son of</p>
    <p class=l>the hero most, from hicetaon sprung,<br />fierce melanippus, gallant, brave, and young.<br />he (ere to troy the grecians cross’d the main)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hiketaon, who erewhile used to pasture his herds of cattle in</p>
    <p class=l>fed his large oxen on percotè’s plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>percote before the war broke out; but when the ships of the</p>
    <p class=l>but when oppress’d, his country claim’d his care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>danaans came, he went back to ilius, where he was eminent among</p>
    <p class=l>return’d to ilion, and excell’d in war;<br />for this, in priam’s court, he held his place,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans, and lived near priam who treated him as one of his</p>
    <p class=l>beloved no less than priam’s royal race.<br />him hector singled, as his troops he led,<br />and thus inflamed him, pointing to the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>own sons.</p>
    <p class=l>“lo, melanippus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector now rebuked him and said, “why, melanippus, are</p>
    <p class=l>lo, where dolops lies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we thus remiss?</p>
    <p class=l>and is it thus our royal kinsman dies?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do you take no note of the death of your kinsman,</p>
    <p class=l>o’ermatch’d he falls; to two at once a prey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and do you not see how they are trying to take dolops’s armour?</p>
    <p class=l>and lo!<br />they bear the bloody arms away!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>follow me; there must be no fighting the argives from a distance</p>
    <p class=l>come on—a distant war no longer wage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, but we must do so in close combat till either we kill them</p>
    <p class=l>but hand to hand thy country’s foes engage:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or they take the high wall of ilius and slay her people.</p>
    <p class=l>till greece at once, and all her glory end;<br />or ilion from her towery height descend,<br />heaved from the lowest stone; and bury all<br />in one sad sepulchre, one common fall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he led on as he spoke, and the hero melanippus followed after.</p>
    <p class=l>hector (this said) rush’d forward on the foes:<br />with equal ardour melanippus glows:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile ajax son of telamon was cheering on the argives.</p>
    <p class=l>then ajax thus—“o greeks!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my</p>
    <p class=l>respect your fame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>friends,” he cried, “be men, and fear dishonour; quit yourselves</p>
    <p class=l>respect yourselves, and learn an honest shame:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in battle so as to win respect from one another.</p>
    <p class=l>let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire,<br />and catch from breast to breast the noble fire,<br />on valour’s side the odds of combat lie;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men who respect</p>
    <p class=l>the brave live glorious, or lamented die;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>each other’s good opinion are less likely to be killed than those</p>
    <p class=l>the wretch that trembles in the field of fame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who do not, but in flight there is neither gain nor glory.</p>
    <p class=l>meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back</p>
    <p class=l>his generous sense he not in vain imparts;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>it sunk, and rooted in the grecian hearts:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they laid his words to heart and hedged the ships as</p>
    <p class=l>they join, they throng, they thicken at his call,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with a wall of bronze, while jove urged on the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>and flank the navy with a brazen wall;<br />shields touching shields, in order blaze above,<br />and stop the trojans, though impell’d by jove.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus</p>
    <p class=l>the fiery spartan first, with loud applause.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the loud battle-cry urged antilochus on.</p>
    <p class=l>warms the bold son of nestor in his cause.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“antilochus,” said<br />he, “you are young and there is none of the achaeans more fleet</p>
    <p class=l>“is there (he said) in arms a youth like you,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of foot or more valiant than you are.</p>
    <p class=l>so strong to fight, so active to pursue?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see if you cannot spring</p>
    <p class=l>why stand you distant, nor attempt a deed?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon some trojan and kill him.</p>
    <p class=l>lift the bold lance, and make some trojan bleed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he hurried away when he had thus spurred antilochus, who at once</p>
    <p class=l>he said; and backward to the lines retired;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>darted out from the front ranks and aimed a spear, after looking</p>
    <p class=l>forth rush’d the youth with martial fury fired,<br />beyond the foremost ranks; his lance he threw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>carefully round him.</p>
    <p class=l>and round the black battalions cast his view.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans fell back as he threw, and the</p>
    <p class=l>the troops of troy recede with sudden fear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dart did not speed from his hand without effect, for it struck</p>
    <p class=l>while the swift javelin hiss’d along in air.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>melanippus the proud son of hiketaon in the breast by the nipple</p>
    <p class=l>advancing melanippus met the dart<br />with his bold breast, and felt it in his heart:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he was coming forward, and his armour rang rattling round him</p>
    <p class=l>thundering he falls; his falling arms resound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he fell heavily to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>and his broad buckler rings against the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>antilochus sprang upon him as a</p>
    <p class=l>the victor leaps upon his prostrate prize:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dog springs on a fawn which a hunter has hit as it was breaking</p>
    <p class=l>thus on a roe the well-breath’d beagle flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>away from its covert, and killed it.<br />even so, o melanippus, did</p>
    <p class=l>and rends his side, fresh-bleeding with the dart</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stalwart antilochus spring upon you to strip you of your armour;</p>
    <p class=l>the distant hunter sent into his heart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but noble hector marked him, and came running up to him through</p>
    <p class=l>observing hector to the rescue flew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the thick of the battle.<br />antilochus, brave soldier though he was,<br />would not stay to face him, but fled like some savage creature</p>
    <p class=l>bold as he was, antilochus withdrew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which knows it has done wrong, and flies, when it has killed a</p>
    <p class=l>so when a savage, ranging o’er the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dog or a man who is herding his cattle, before a body of men can</p>
    <p class=l>has torn the shepherd’s dog, or shepherd’s swain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be gathered to attack it.</p>
    <p class=l>while conscious of the deed, he glares around,<br />and hears the gathering multitude resound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so did the son of nestor fly, and</p>
    <p class=l>timely he flies the yet-untasted food,<br />and gains the friendly shelter of the wood:<br />so fears the youth; all troy with shouts pursue,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans and hector with a cry that rent the air showered</p>
    <p class=l>while stones and darts in mingled tempest flew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their weapons after him; nor did he turn round and stay his</p>
    <p class=l>but enter’d in the grecian ranks, he turns</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flight till he had reached his comrades.</p>
    <p class=l>his manly breast, and with new fury burns.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards the</p>
    <p class=l>now on the fleet the tides of trojans drove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships in fulfilment of the behests of jove who kept spurring them</p>
    <p class=l>fierce to fulfil the stern decrees of jove:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on to new deeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the</p>
    <p class=l>the sire of gods, confirming thetis’ prayer,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>argives and defeated them by encouraging the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>the grecian ardour quench’d in deep despair;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for he<br />meant giving glory to hector son of priam, and letting him throw</p>
    <p class=l>but lifts to glory troy’s prevailing bands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fire upon the ships, till he had fulfilled the unrighteous prayer</p>
    <p class=l>swells all their hearts, and strengthens all their hands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that thetis had made him; jove, therefore, bided his time till he</p>
    <p class=l>on ida’s top he waits with longing eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should see the glare of a blazing ship.</p>
    <p class=l>to view the navy blazing to the skies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from that hour he was<br />about so to order that the trojans should be driven back from the</p>
    <p class=l>then, nor till then, the scale of war shall turn,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships and to vouchsafe glory to the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the trojans fly, and conquer’d ilion burn.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this purpose</p>
    <p class=l>these fates revolved in his almighty mind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he inspired hector son of priam, who was eager enough already, to</p>
    <p class=l>he raises hector to the work design’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>assail the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>bids him with more than mortal fury glow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his fury was as that of mars, or as when a fire</p>
    <p class=l>and drives him, like a lightning, on the foe.<br />so mars, when human crimes for vengeance call,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is raging in the glades of some dense forest upon the mountains;</p>
    <p class=l>shakes his huge javelin, and whole armies fall.<br />not with more rage a conflagration rolls,<br />wraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared under his terrible</p>
    <p class=l>he foams with wrath; beneath his gloomy brow<br />like fiery meteors his red eye-balls glow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eyebrows, and his helmet quivered on his temples by reason of</p>
    <p class=l>the radiant helmet on his temple burns,<br />waves when he nods, and lightens as he turns:<br />for jove his splendour round the chief had thrown,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fury with which he fought.</p>
    <p class=l>and cast the blaze of both the hosts on one.<br />unhappy glories!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove from heaven was with him, and</p>
    <p class=l>for his fate was near,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>though he was but one against many, vouchsafed him victory and</p>
    <p class=l>due to stern pallas, and pelides’ spear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glory; for he was doomed to an early death, and already pallas</p>
    <p class=l>yet jove deferr’d the death he was to pay,<br />and gave what fate allow’d, the honours of a day!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva was hurrying on the hour of his destruction at the hands</p>
    <p class=l>now all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the son of peleus.</p>
    <p class=l>burn at each foe, and single every prize;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, however, he kept trying to break the<br />ranks of the enemy wherever he could see them thickest, and in</p>
    <p class=l>still at the closest ranks, the thickest fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the goodliest armour; but do what he might he could not break</p>
    <p class=l>he points his ardour, and exerts his might.<br />the grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower,<br />on all sides batter’d, yet resists his power:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through them, for they stood as a tower foursquare, or as some</p>
    <p class=l>so some tall rock o’erhangs the hoary main,[241]<br />by winds assail’d, by billows beat in vain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>high cliff rising from the grey sea that braves the anger of the</p>
    <p class=l>unmoved it hears, above, the tempest blow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gale, and of the waves that thunder up against it.</p>
    <p class=l>and sees the watery mountains break below.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he fell upon</p>
    <p class=l>girt in surrounding flames, he seems to fall</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them like flames of fire from every quarter.</p>
    <p class=l>like fire from jove, and bursts upon them all:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when a wave,</p>
    <p class=l>bursts as a wave that from the cloud impends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>raised mountain high by wind and storm, breaks over a ship and</p>
    <p class=l>and, swell’d with tempests, on the ship descends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>covers it deep in foam, the fierce winds roar against the mast,</p>
    <p class=l>white are the decks with foam; the winds aloud<br />howl o’er the masts, and sing through every shroud:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the hearts of the sailors fail them for fear, and they are saved</p>
    <p class=l>pale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but by a very little from destruction—even so were the hearts of</p>
    <p class=l>and instant death on every wave appears.<br />so pale the greeks the eyes of hector meet,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans fainting within them.</p>
    <p class=l>the chief so thunders, and so shakes the fleet.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or as a savage lion attacking</p>
    <p class=l>as when a lion, rushing from his den,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a herd of cows while they are feeding by thousands in the</p>
    <p class=l>amidst the plain of some wide-water’d fen,<br />(where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>low-lying meadows by some wide-watered shore—the herdsman is at</p>
    <p class=l>at large expatiate o’er the ranker mead)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his wit’s end how to protect his herd and keeps going about now</p>
    <p class=l>leaps on the herds before the herdsman’s eyes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the van and now in the rear of his cattle, while the lion</p>
    <p class=l>the trembling herdsman far to distance flies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>springs into the thick of them and fastens on a cow so that they</p>
    <p class=l>some lordly bull (the rest dispersed and fled)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all tremble for fear—even so were the achaeans utterly</p>
    <p class=l>he singles out; arrests, and lays him dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>panic-stricken by hector and father jove.</p>
    <p class=l>thus from the rage of jove-like hector flew</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevertheless hector</p>
    <p class=l>all greece in heaps; but one he seized, and slew:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>only killed periphetes of mycenae; he was son of copreus who was</p>
    <p class=l>mycenian periphes, a mighty name,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wont to take the orders of king eurystheus to mighty hercules,</p>
    <p class=l>in wisdom great, in arms well known to fame;<br />the minister of stern eurystheus’ ire<br />against alcides, copreus was his sire:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but the son was a far better man than the father in every way; he</p>
    <p class=l>the son redeem’d the honours of the race,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was fleet of foot, a valiant warrior, and in understanding ranked</p>
    <p class=l>a son as generous as the sire was base;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among the foremost men of mycenae.</p>
    <p class=l>o’er all his country’s youth conspicuous far</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he it was who then afforded</p>
    <p class=l>in every virtue, or of peace or war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector a triumph, for as he was turning back he stumbled against</p>
    <p class=l>but doom’d to hector’s stronger force to yield!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the rim of his shield which reached his feet, and served to keep</p>
    <p class=l>against the margin of his ample shield<br />he struck his hasty foot: his heels up-sprung;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the javelins off him.<br />he tripped against this and fell face<br />upward, his helmet ringing loudly about his head as he did so.</p>
    <p class=l>supine he fell; his brazen helmet rung.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector saw him fall and ran up to him; he then thrust a spear</p>
    <p class=l>on the fallen chief the invading trojan press’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into his chest, and killed him close to his own comrades.</p>
    <p class=l>and plunged the pointed javelin in his breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these,<br />for all their sorrow, could not help him for they were themselves</p>
    <p class=l>his circling friends, who strove to guard too late</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>terribly afraid of hector.</p>
    <p class=l>the unhappy hero, fled, or shared his fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they had now reached the ships and the prows of those that had<br />been drawn up first were on every side of them, but the trojans</p>
    <p class=l>chased from the foremost line, the grecian train</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came pouring after them.</p>
    <p class=l>now man the next, receding toward the main:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the argives were driven back from the<br />first row of ships, but they made a stand by their tents without</p>
    <p class=l>wedged in one body at the tents they stand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>being broken up and scattered; shame and fear restrained them.</p>
    <p class=l>wall’d round with sterns, a gloomy, desperate band.<br />now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight;<br />now fear itself confines them to the fight:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they kept shouting incessantly to one another, and nestor of</p>
    <p class=l>man courage breathes in man; but nestor most</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gerene, tower of strength to the achaeans, was loudest in</p>
    <p class=l>(the sage preserver of the grecian host)<br />exhorts, adjures, to guard these utmost shores;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>imploring every man by his parents, and beseeching him to stand</p>
    <p class=l>and by their parents, by themselves implores.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>firm.</p>
    <p class=l>“oh friends!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“be men, my friends,” he cried, “and respect one another’s good</p>
    <p class=l>be men: your generous breasts inflame</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>opinion.</p>
    <p class=l>with mutual honour, and with mutual shame!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>think, all of you, on your children, your wives, your</p>
    <p class=l>think of your hopes, your fortunes; all the care<br />your wives, your infants, and your parents share:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>property, and your parents whether these be alive or dead.</p>
    <p class=l>think of each living father’s reverend head;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on</p>
    <p class=l>think of each ancestor with glory dead;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their behalf though they are not here, i implore you to stand</p>
    <p class=l>absent, by me they speak, by me they sue,<br />they ask their safety, and their fame, from you:<br />the gods their fates on this one action lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>firm, and not to turn in flight.</p>
    <p class=l>and all are lost, if you desert the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he put heart and soul into them all.</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, and round him breathed heroic fires;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva</p>
    <p class=l>minerva seconds what the sage inspires.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lifted the thick veil of darkness from their eyes, and much light</p>
    <p class=l>the mist of darkness jove around them threw<br />she clear’d, restoring all the war to view;<br />a sudden ray shot beaming o’er the plain,<br />and show’d the shores, the navy, and the main:<br />hector they saw, and all who fly, or fight,<br />the scene wide-opening to the blaze of light,<br />first of the field great ajax strikes their eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fell upon them, alike on the side of the ships and on that where</p>
    <p class=l>his port majestic, and his ample size:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fight was raging.</p>
    <p class=l>a ponderous mace with studs of iron crown’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they could see hector and all his men, both</p>
    <p class=l>full twenty cubits long, he swings around;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>those in the rear who were taking no part in the battle, and<br />those who were fighting by the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>nor fights, like others, fix’d to certain stands</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax could not bring himself to retreat along with the rest, but</p>
    <p class=l>but looks a moving tower above the bands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strode from deck to deck with a great sea-pike in his hands</p>
    <p class=l>high on the decks with vast gigantic stride,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>twelve cubits long and jointed with rings.</p>
    <p class=l>the godlike hero stalks from side to side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as a man skilled in</p>
    <p class=l>so when a horseman from the watery mead<br />(skill’d in the manage of the bounding steed)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>feats of horsemanship couples four horses together and comes</p>
    <p class=l>drives four fair coursers, practised to obey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tearing full speed along the public way from the country into<br />some large town—many both men and women marvel as they see him</p>
    <p class=l>to some great city through the public way;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for he keeps all the time changing his horse, springing from one</p>
    <p class=l>safe in his art, as side by side they run,<br />he shifts his seat, and vaults from one to one;<br />and now to this, and now to that he flies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to another without ever missing his feet while the horses are at</p>
    <p class=l>admiring numbers follow with their eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a gallop—even so did ajax go striding from one ship’s deck to</p>
    <p class=l>from ship to ship thus ajax swiftly flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>another, and his voice went up into the heavens.</p>
    <p class=l>no less the wonder of the warring crew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he kept on</p>
    <p class=l>as furious, hector thunder’d threats aloud,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shouting his orders to the danaans and exhorting them to defend</p>
    <p class=l>and rush’d enraged before the trojan crowd;<br />then swift invades the ships, whose beaky prores</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their ships and tents; neither did hector remain within the main</p>
    <p class=l>lay rank’d contiguous on the bending shores;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body of the trojan warriors, but as a dun eagle swoops down upon</p>
    <p class=l>so the strong eagle from his airy height,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a flock of wild-fowl feeding near a river—geese, it may be, or</p>
    <p class=l>who marks the swans’ or cranes’ embodied flight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cranes, or long-necked swans—even so did hector make straight for</p>
    <p class=l>stoops down impetuous, while they light for food,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a dark-prowed ship, rushing right towards it; for jove with his</p>
    <p class=l>and, stooping, darkens with his wings the flood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty hand impelled him forward, and roused his people to follow</p>
    <p class=l>jove leads him on with his almighty hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him.</p>
    <p class=l>and breathes fierce spirits in his following band.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now the battle again raged furiously at the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>the warring nations meet, the battle roars,<br />thick beats the combat on the sounding prores.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you would</p>
    <p class=l>thou wouldst have thought, so furious was their fire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have thought the men were coming on fresh and unwearied, so</p>
    <p class=l>no force could tame them, and no toil could tire;<br />as if new vigour from new fights they won,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fiercely did they fight; and this was the mind in which they</p>
    <p class=l>and the long battle was but then begun.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were—the achaeans did not believe they should escape destruction</p>
    <p class=l>greece, yet unconquer’d, kept alive the war,<br />secure of death, confiding in despair:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but thought themselves doomed, while there was not a trojan but</p>
    <p class=l>troy in proud hopes already view’d the main</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his heart beat high with the hope of firing the ships and putting</p>
    <p class=l>bright with the blaze, and red with heroes slain:<br />like strength is felt from hope, and from despair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaean heroes to the sword.<br />thus were the two sides minded.</p>
    <p class=l>and each contends, as his were all the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then hector seized the stern of</p>
    <p class=l>’twas thou, bold hector!<br />whose resistless hand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the good ship that had brought protesilaus to troy, but never</p>
    <p class=l>first seized a ship on that contested strand;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bore him back to his native land.</p>
    <p class=l>the same which dead protesilaüs bore,[242]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>round this ship there raged a</p>
    <p class=l>the first that touch’d the unhappy trojan shore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>close hand-to-hand fight between danaans and trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>for this in arms the warring nations stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they did</p>
    <p class=l>and bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not fight at a distance with bows and javelins, but with one mind</p>
    <p class=l>no room to poise the lance or bend the bow;</p>

    <p class=l>even ajax paused, (so thick the javelins fly,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by the darts that were flung at him, and made sure that he was</p>

    <p class=r>then patroclus</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus coming from his hated head, whereas that of murderous</p>
    <p class=l>no longer flames the lance of tydeus’ son;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector rings in my cars as he gives orders to the trojans, who</p>
    <p class=l>no more your general calls his heroes on:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>triumph over the achaeans and fill the whole plain with their cry</p>
    <p class=l>hector, alone, i hear; his dreadful breath</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of battle.</p>
    <p class=l>commands your slaughter, or proclaims your death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but even so, patroclus, fall upon them and save the</p>
    <p class=l>yet now, patroclus, issue to the plain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fleet, lest the trojans fire it and prevent us from being able to</p>
    <p class=l>now save the ships, the rising fires restrain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>return.</p>
    <p class=l>and give the greeks to visit greece again.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do, however, as i now bid you, that you may win me great</p>
    <p class=l>but heed my words, and mark a friend’s command,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>honour from all the danaans, and that they may restore the girl<br />to me again and give me rich gifts into the bargain.</p>
    <p class=l>who trusts his fame and honours in thy hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when you</p>
    <p class=l>and from thy deeds expects the achaian host</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have driven the trojans from the ships, come back again.</p>
    <p class=l>shall render back the beauteous maid he lost:<br />rage uncontroll’d through all the hostile crew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>though</p>
    <p class=l>but touch not hector, hector is my due.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>juno’s thundering husband should put triumph within your reach,</p>
    <p class=l>though jove in thunder should command the war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do not fight the trojans further in my absence, or you will rob<br />me of glory that should be mine.</p>
    <p class=l>be just, consult my glory, and forbear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and do not for lust of battle go</p>
    <p class=l>the fleet once saved, desist from further chase,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on killing the trojans nor lead the achaeans on to ilius, lest</p>
    <p class=l>nor lead to ilion’s walls the grecian race;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one of the ever-living gods from olympus attack you—for phoebus</p>
    <p class=l>some adverse god thy rashness may destroy;<br />some god, like phœbus, ever kind to troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo loves them well: return when you have freed the ships from</p>
    <p class=l>let greece, redeem’d from this destructive strait,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>peril, and let others wage war upon the plain.</p>
    <p class=l>do her own work; and leave the rest to fate.</p>

    <p class=r>would, by father</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans might be left alive, nor yet of the argives, but that we</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two might be alone left to tear aside the mantle that veils the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brow of troy.</p>
    <p class=l>and only we destroy the accursed town!</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did they converse.</p>
    <p class=l>such conference held the chiefs; while on the strand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but ajax could no longer hold his ground</p>
    <p class=l>great jove with conquest crown’d the trojan band.<br />ajax no more the sounding storm sustain’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the shower of darts that rained upon him; the will of jove</p>
    <p class=l>so thick the darts an iron tempest rain’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and the javelins of the trojans were too much for him; the helmet</p>
    <p class=l>on his tired arm the weighty buckler hung;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that gleamed about his temples rang with the continuous clatter</p>
    <p class=l>his hollow helm with falling javelins rung;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the missiles that kept pouring on to it and on to the</p>
    <p class=l>his breath, in quick short pantings, comes and goes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cheek-pieces that protected his face.<br />moreover his left shoulder</p>
    <p class=l>and painful sweat from all his members flows.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was tired with having held his shield so long, yet for all this,<br />let fly at him as they would, they could not make him give<br />ground.<br />he could hardly draw his breath, the sweat rained from</p>
    <p class=l>spent and o’erpower’d, he barely breathes at most;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>every pore of his body, he had not a moment’s respite, and on all</p>
    <p class=l>yet scarce an army stirs him from his post;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sides he was beset by danger upon danger.</p>
    <p class=l>dangers on dangers all around him glow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now, tell me, o muses that hold your mansions on olympus, how</p>
    <p class=l>and toil to toil, and woe succeeds to woe.<br />say, muses, throned above the starry frame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fire was thrown upon the ships of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>how first the navy blazed with trojan flame?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector came close</p>
    <p class=l>stern hector waved his sword, and standing near,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>up and let drive with his great sword at the ashen spear of ajax.</p>
    <p class=l>where furious ajax plied his ashen spear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he cut it clean in two just behind where the point was fastened<br />on to the shaft of the spear.<br />ajax, therefore, had now nothing</p>
    <p class=l>full on the lance a stroke so justly sped,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but a headless spear, while the bronze point flew some way off</p>
    <p class=l>that the broad falchion lopp’d its brazen head;<br />his pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and came ringing down on to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>the brazen head falls sounding on the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax knew the hand of</p>
    <p class=l>great ajax saw, and own’d the hand divine;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heaven in this, and was dismayed at seeing that jove had now left</p>
    <p class=l>confessing jove, and trembling at the sign,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him utterly defenceless and was willing victory for the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>warn’d he retreats.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore he drew back, and the trojans flung fire upon the ship</p>
    <p class=l>then swift from all sides pour</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which was at once wrapped in flame.</p>
    <p class=l>the hissing brands; thick streams the fiery shower;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fire was now flaring about the ship’s stern, whereon achilles</p>
    <p class=l>o’er the high stern the curling volumes rise,<br />and sheets of rolling smoke involve the skies.<br />divine achilles view’d the rising flames,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>smote his two thighs and said to patroclus, “up, noble knight,</p>
    <p class=l>and smote his thigh, and thus aloud exclaims:<br />“arm, arm, patroclus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for i see the glare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they</p>
    <p class=l>lo, the blaze aspires!<br />the glowing ocean reddens with the fires.<br />arm, ere our vessels catch the spreading flame;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>destroy our ships, and there be no way by which we may retreat.</p>
    <p class=l>arm, ere the grecians be no more a name;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gird on your armour at once while i call our people together.</p>
    <p class=l>i haste to bring the troops.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”—the hero said;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke patroclus put on his armour.</p>
    <p class=l>the friend with ardour and with joy obey’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first he greaved his</p>
    <p class=l>he cased his limbs in brass; and first around</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>legs with greaves of good make, and fitted with ancle-clasps of</p>
    <p class=l>his manly legs, with silver buckles bound</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>silver; after this he donned the cuirass of the son of aeacus,</p>
    <p class=l>the clasping greaves; then to his breast applies</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>richly inlaid and studded.</p>
    <p class=l>the flaming cuirass of a thousand dyes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he hung his silver-studded sword of<br />bronze about his shoulders, and then his mighty shield.</p>
    <p class=l>emblazed with studs of gold his falchion shone</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on his</p>
    <p class=l>in the rich belt, as in a starry zone:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>comely head he set his helmet, well wrought, with a crest of</p>
    <p class=l>achilles’ shield his ample shoulders spread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it.</p>
    <p class=l>achilles’ helmet nodded o’er his head:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he grasped two</p>
    <p class=l>adorn’d in all his terrible array,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>redoubtable spears that suited his hands, but he did not take the</p>
    <p class=l>he flash’d around intolerable day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear of noble achilles, so stout and strong, for none other of</p>
    <p class=l>alone untouch’d, pelides’ javelin stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans could wield it, though achilles could do so easily.</p>
    <p class=l>not to be poised but by pelides’ hands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this was the ashen spear from mount pelion, which chiron had cut</p>
    <p class=l>from pelion’s shady brow the plant entire<br />old chiron rent, and shaped it for his sire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon a mountain top and had given to peleus, wherewith to deal</p>
    <p class=l>whose son’s great arm alone the weapon wields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>out death among heroes.</p>
    <p class=l>the death of heroes, and the dread of fields.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he bade automedon yoke his horses with</p>
    <p class=l>[illustration: ] buckles<br />the brave automedon (an honour’d name,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all speed, for he was the man whom he held in honour next after</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles, and on whose support in battle he could rely most</p>

    <p class=r>firmly.</p>
    <p class=l>the winged coursers harness’d to the car;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>automedon therefore yoked the fleet horses xanthus and</p>
    <p class=l>xanthus and balius, of immortal breed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>balius, steeds that could fly like the wind: these were they whom</p>
    <p class=l>sprung from the wind, and like the wind in speed.</p>

    <p class=l>by zephyr pregnant on the breezy shore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the side traces he</p>
    <p class=l>swift pedasus was added to their side,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>set the noble horse pedasus, whom achilles had brought away with</p>
    <p class=l>(once great aëtion’s, now achilles’ pride)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him when he sacked the city of eetion, and who, mortal steed<br />though he was, could take his place along with those that were</p>
    <p class=l>who, like in strength, in swiftness, and in grace,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>immortal.</p>
    <p class=l>a mortal courser match’d the immortal race.</p>

    <p class=r>meanwhile achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and</p>
    <p class=l>achilles speeds from tent to tent, and warms</p>

    <p class=l>grim as voracious wolves, that seek the springs[244]<br />when scalding thirst their burning bowels wrings;<br />when some tall stag, fresh-slaughtered in the wood,</p>

    <p class=r>a pack to lap water from the clear spring with their long thin</p>
    <p class=l>to the black fount they rush, a hideous throng,</p>

    <p class=r>tongues; and they reek of blood and slaughter; they know not what</p>
    <p class=l>with paunch distended, and with lolling tongue,<br />fire fills their eye, their black jaws belch the gore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fear is, for it is hunger drives them—even so did the leaders and</p>
    <p class=l>and gorged with slaughter still they thirst for more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>counsellors of the myrmidons gather round the good squire of the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fleet descendant of aeacus, and among them stood achilles himself</p>
    <p class=l>such their dread strength, and such their deathful view.<br />high in the midst the great achilles stands,</p>

    <p class=r>fifty ships had noble achilles brought to troy, and in each there</p>

    <p class=r>into an upper chamber, and lay with her in secret, whereon she</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they</p>
    <p class=l>thus while he roused the fire in every breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>serried their companies yet more closely when they heard the</p>
    <p class=l>close and more close the listening cohorts press’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>words of their king.</p>
    <p class=l>ranks wedged in ranks; of arms a steely ring<br />still grows, and spreads, and thickens round the king.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as the stones which a builder sets in the<br />wall of some high house which is to give shelter from the</p>
    <p class=l>as when a circling wall the builder forms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>winds—even so closely were the helmets and bossed shields set</p>
    <p class=l>of strength defensive against wind and storms,<br />compacted stones the thickening work compose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against one another.</p>
    <p class=l>and round him wide the rising structure grows:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shield pressed on shield, helm on helm, and</p>
    <p class=l>so helm to helm, and crest to crest they throng,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>man on man; so close were they that the horse-hair plumes on the</p>
    <p class=l>shield urged on shield, and man drove man along;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gleaming ridges of their helmets touched each other as they bent</p>
    <p class=l>thick, undistinguish’d plumes, together join’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their heads.</p>
    <p class=l>float in one sea, and wave before the wind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in front of them all two men put on their armour—patroclus and</p>
    <p class=l>far o’er the rest in glittering pomp appear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>automedon—two men, with but one mind to lead the myrmidons.</p>
    <p class=l>there bold automedon, patroclus here;<br />brothers in arms, with equal fury fired;<br />two friends, two bodies with one soul inspired.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then</p>
    <p class=l>but mindful of the gods, achilles went</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles went inside his tent and opened the lid of the strong</p>
    <p class=l>to the rich coffer in his shady tent;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chest which silver-footed thetis had given him to take on board<br />ship, and which she had filled with shirts, cloaks to keep out</p>
    <p class=l>there lay on heaps his various garments roll’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the cold, and good thick rugs.</p>
    <p class=l>and costly furs, and carpets stiff with gold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in this chest he had a cup of rare</p>
    <p class=l>(the presents of the silver-footed dame)<br />from thence he took a bowl, of antique frame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>workmanship, from which no man but himself might drink, nor would</p>
    <p class=l>which never man had stained with ruddy wine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he make offering from it to any other god save only to father</p>
    <p class=l>nor raised in offerings to the power divine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove.</p>
    <p class=l>but peleus’ son; and peleus’ son to none</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he took the cup from the chest and cleansed it with</p>
    <p class=l>had raised in offerings, but to jove alone.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sulphur; this done he rinsed it clean water, and after he had</p>
    <p class=l>this tinged with sulphur, sacred first to flame,<br />he purged; and wash’d it in the running stream.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>washed his hands he drew wine.<br />then he stood in the middle of the</p>
    <p class=l>then cleansed his hands; and fixing for a space</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>court and prayed, looking towards heaven, and making his</p>
    <p class=l>his eyes on heaven, his feet upon the place</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drink-offering of wine; nor was he unseen of jove whose joy is in</p>
    <p class=l>of sacrifice, the purple draught he pour’d<br />forth in the midst; and thus the god implored:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thunder.</p>
    <p class=l>“o thou supreme!<br />high-throned all height above!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“king jove,” he cried, “lord of dodona, god of the</p>
    <p class=l>o great pelasgic, dodonaean jove!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pelasgi, who dwellest afar, you who hold wintry dodona in your</p>
    <p class=l>who ’midst surrounding frosts, and vapours chill,<br />presid’st on bleak dodona’s vocal hill:<br />(whose groves the selli, race austere!<br />surround,<br />their feet unwash’d, their slumbers on the ground;<br />who hear, from rustling oaks, thy dark decrees;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sway, where your prophets the selli dwell around you with their</p>
    <p class=l>and catch the fates, low-whispered in the breeze;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>feet unwashed and their couches made upon the ground—if you heard</p>
    <p class=l>hear, as of old!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me when i prayed to you aforetime, and did me honour while you</p>
    <p class=l>thou gav’st, at thetis’ prayer,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sent disaster on the achaeans, vouchsafe me now the fulfilment of</p>
    <p class=l>glory to me, and to the greeks despair.<br />lo, to the dangers of the fighting field</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yet this further prayer.</p>
    <p class=l>the best, the dearest of my friends, i yield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i shall stay here where my ships are</p>
    <p class=l>though still determined, to my ships confined;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lying, but i shall send my comrade into battle at the head of</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus gone, i stay but half behind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many myrmidons.</p>
    <p class=l>oh!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grant, o all-seeing jove, that victory may go</p>
    <p class=l>be his guard thy providential care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with him; put your courage into his heart that hector may learn</p>
    <p class=l>confirm his heart, and string his arm to war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whether my squire is man enough to fight alone, or whether his<br />might is only then so indomitable when i myself enter the turmoil</p>
    <p class=l>press’d by his single force let hector see</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of war.</p>
    <p class=l>his fame in arms not owing all to me.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>afterwards when he has chased the fight and the cry of</p>
    <p class=l>but when the fleets are saved from foes and fire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battle from the ships, grant that he may return unharmed, with</p>
    <p class=l>let him with conquest and renown retire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his armour and his comrades, fighters in close combat.</p>
    <p class=l>preserve his arms, preserve his social train,<br />and safe return him to these eyes again!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he pray, and all-counselling jove heard his prayer.<br />part</p>
    <p class=l>great jove consents to half the chief’s request,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of it he did indeed vouchsafe him—but not the whole.</p>
    <p class=l>but heaven’s eternal doom denies the rest;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he granted<br />that patroclus should thrust back war and battle from the ships,</p>
    <p class=l>to free the fleet was granted to his prayer;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but refused to let him come safely out of the fight.</p>
    <p class=l>his safe return, the winds dispersed in air.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had made his drink-offering and had thus prayed, achilles<br />went inside his tent and put back the cup into his chest.<br />then he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the</p>
    <p class=l>back to his tent the stern achilles flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fierce fight that raged between the trojans and achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>and waits the combat with impatient eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the armed band that was about patroclus marched on till</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile the troops beneath patroclus’ care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they sprang high in hope upon the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>invade the trojans, and commence the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they came swarming out<br />like wasps whose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly<br />children love to tease, whereon any one who happens to be passing</p>
    <p class=l>as wasps, provoked by children in their play,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may get stung—or again, if a wayfarer going along the road vexes</p>
    <p class=l>pour from their mansions by the broad highway,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them by accident, every wasp will come flying out in a fury to</p>
    <p class=l>in swarms the guiltless traveller engage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>defend his little ones—even with such rage and courage did the</p>
    <p class=l>whet all their stings, and call forth all their rage:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>myrmidons swarm from their ships, and their cry of battle rose</p>
    <p class=l>all rise in arms, and, with a general cry,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heavenwards.</p>
    <p class=l>assert their waxen domes, and buzzing progeny.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus called out to his men at the top of his</p>
    <p class=l>thus from the tents the fervent legion swarms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>voice, “myrmidons, followers of achilles son of peleus, be men my</p>
    <p class=l>so loud their clamours, and so keen their arms:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>friends, fight with might and with main, that we may win glory</p>
    <p class=l>their rising rage patroclus’ breath inspires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the son of peleus, who is far the foremost man at the ships</p>
    <p class=l>who thus inflames them with heroic fires:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the argives—he, and his close fighting followers.</p>
    <p class=l>“o warriors, partners of achilles’ praise!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of</p>
    <p class=l>be mindful of your deeds in ancient days;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus king agamemnon will thus learn his folly in showing no</p>
    <p class=l>your godlike master let your acts proclaim,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>respect to the bravest of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>and add new glories to his mighty name.<br />think your achilles sees you fight: be brave,<br />and humble the proud monarch whom you save.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they</p>
    <p class=l>joyful they heard, and kindling as he spoke,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fell in a body upon the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>flew to the fleet, involved in fire and smoke.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ships rang again with the</p>
    <p class=l>from shore to shore the doubling shouts resound,<br />the hollow ships return a deeper sound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cry which the achaeans raised, and when the trojans saw the brave</p>
    <p class=l>the war stood still, and all around them gazed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of menoetius and his squire all gleaming in their armour,</p>
    <p class=l>when great achilles’ shining armour blazed:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were daunted and their battalions were thrown into<br />confusion, for they thought the fleet son of peleus must now have<br />put aside his anger, and have been reconciled to agamemnon; every</p>
    <p class=l>troy saw, and thought the dread achilles nigh,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one, therefore, looked round about to see whither he might fly</p>
    <p class=l>at once they see, they tremble, and they fly.<br />then first thy spear, divine patroclus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for safety.</p>
    <p class=l>flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus first aimed a spear into the middle of the press where</p>
    <p class=l>where the war raged, and where the tumult grew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men were packed most closely, by the stern of the ship of</p>
    <p class=l>close to the stern of that famed ship which bore</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>protesilaus.</p>
    <p class=l>unbless’d protesilaus to ilion’s shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he hit pyraechmes who had led his paeonian horsemen</p>
    <p class=l>the great pæonian, bold pyrechmes stood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from the amydon and the broad waters of the river axius; the</p>
    <p class=l>(who led his bands from axius’ winding flood;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear struck him on the right shoulder, and with a groan he fell</p>
    <p class=l>his shoulder-blade receives the fatal wound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>backwards in the dust; on this his men were thrown into</p>
    <p class=l>the groaning warrior pants upon the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>confusion, for by killing their leader, who was the finest<br />soldier among them, patroclus struck panic into them all.</p>
    <p class=l>his troops, that see their country’s glory slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he thus</p>
    <p class=l>fly diverse, scatter’d o’er the distant plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drove them from the ship and quenched the fire that was then</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus’ arm forbids the spreading fires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>blazing—leaving the half-burnt ship to lie where it was.</p>
    <p class=l>and from the half-burn’d ship proud troy retires;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>clear’d from the smoke the joyful navy lies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans were now driven back with a shout that rent the skies,</p>
    <p class=l>in heaps on heaps the foe tumultuous flies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while the danaans poured after them from their ships, shouting</p>
    <p class=l>triumphant greece her rescued decks ascends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>also without ceasing.</p>
    <p class=l>and loud acclaim the starry region rends.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when jove, gatherer of the</p>
    <p class=l>so when thick clouds enwrap the mountain’s head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thunder-cloud, spreads a dense canopy on the top of some lofty</p>
    <p class=l>o’er heaven’s expanse like one black ceiling spread;<br />sudden the thunderer, with a flashing ray,<br />bursts through the darkness, and lets down the day:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mountain, and all the peaks, the jutting headlands, and forest</p>
    <p class=l>the hills shine out, the rocks in prospect rise,<br />and streams, and vales, and forests, strike the eyes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glades show out in the great light that flashes from the bursting</p>
    <p class=l>the smiling scene wide opens to the sight,<br />and all the unmeasured ether flames with light.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heavens, even so when the danaans had now driven back the fire</p>
    <p class=l>but troy repulsed, and scatter’d o’er the plains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from their ships, they took breath for a little while; but the<br />fury of the fight was not yet over, for the trojans were not<br />driven back in utter rout, but still gave battle, and were ousted</p>
    <p class=l>forced from the navy, yet the fight maintains.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from their ground only by sheer fighting.</p>
    <p class=l>now every greek some hostile hero slew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killed</p>
    <p class=l>but still the foremost, bold patroclus flew:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one another when and how they could.<br />the valiant son of menoetius</p>
    <p class=l>as areilycus had turn’d him round,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first drove his spear into the thigh of areilycus just as he was</p>
    <p class=l>sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>turning round; the point went clean through, and broke the bone</p>
    <p class=l>the brazen-pointed spear, with vigour thrown,<br />the thigh transfix’d, and broke the brittle bone:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so that he fell forward.</p>
    <p class=l>headlong he fell.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile menelaus struck thoas in the</p>
    <p class=l>next, thoas was thy chance;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chest, where it was exposed near the rim of his shield, and he</p>
    <p class=l>thy breast, unarm’d, received the spartan lance.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fell dead.<br />the son of phyleus saw amphiclus about to attack him,</p>
    <p class=l>phylides’ dart (as amphidus drew nigh)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and ere he could do so took aim at the upper part of his thigh,</p>
    <p class=l>his blow prevented, and transpierced his thigh,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>where the muscles are thicker than in any other part; the spear<br />tore through all the sinews of the leg, and his eyes were closed</p>
    <p class=l>tore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in darkness.</p>
    <p class=l>in darkness, and in death, the warrior lay.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the sons of nestor one, antilochus, speared</p>
    <p class=l>in equal arms two sons of nestor stand,<br />and two bold brothers of the lycian band:<br />by great antilochus, atymnius dies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atymnius, driving the point of the spear through his throat, and</p>
    <p class=l>pierced in the flank, lamented youth!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>down he fell.</p>
    <p class=l>he lies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>maris then sprang on antilochus in hand-to-hand</p>
    <p class=l>kind maris, bleeding in his brother’s wound,<br />defends the breathless carcase on the ground;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight to avenge his brother, and bestrode the body spear in hand;</p>
    <p class=l>furious he flies, his murderer to engage:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but valiant thrasymedes was too quick for him, and in a moment</p>
    <p class=l>but godlike thrasimed prevents his rage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal his blow; his<br />aim was true, and the spear severed all the muscles at the root</p>
    <p class=l>between his arm and shoulder aims a blow;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of his arm, and tore them right down to the bone, so he fell</p>
    <p class=l>his arm falls spouting on the dust below:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heavily to the ground and his eyes were closed in darkness.</p>
    <p class=l>he sinks, with endless darkness cover’d o’er:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus</p>
    <p class=l>and vents his soul, effused with gushing gore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did these two noble comrades of sarpedon go down to erebus slain<br />by the two sons of nestor; they were the warrior sons of</p>
    <p class=l>slain by two brothers, thus two brothers bleed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>amisodorus, who had reared the invincible chimaera, to the bane</p>
    <p class=l>sarpedon’s friends, amisodarus’ seed;<br />amisodarus, who, by furies led,<br />the bane of men, abhorr’d chimaera bred;<br />skill’d in the dart in vain, his sons expire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of many.</p>
    <p class=l>and pay the forfeit of their guilty sire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax son of oileus sprang on cleobulus and took him</p>
    <p class=l>stopp’d in the tumult cleobulus lies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alive as he was entangled in the crush; but he killed him then</p>
    <p class=l>beneath oïleus’ arm, a living prize;<br />a living prize not long the trojan stood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and there by a sword-blow on the neck.</p>
    <p class=l>the thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sword reeked with his</p>
    <p class=l>plunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>blood, while dark death and the strong hand of fate gripped him<br />and closed his eyes.</p>
    <p class=l>black death, and fate unpitying, seal his eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>peneleos and lycon now met in close fight, for they had missed</p>
    <p class=l>amid the ranks, with mutual thirst of fame,<br />lycon the brave, and fierce peneleus came;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>each other with their spears.<br />they had both thrown without</p>
    <p class=l>in vain their javelins at each other flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>effect, so now they drew their swords.</p>
    <p class=l>now, met in arms, their eager swords they drew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lycon struck the plumed</p>
    <p class=l>on the plumed crest of his bœotian foe<br />the daring lycon aim’d a noble blow;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>crest of peneleos’ helmet but his sword broke at the hilt, while</p>
    <p class=l>the sword broke short; but his, peneleus sped</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>peneleos smote lycon on the neck under the ear.</p>
    <p class=l>full on the juncture of the neck and head:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the blade sank so<br />deep that the head was held on by nothing but the skin, and there</p>
    <p class=l>the head, divided by a stroke so just,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was no more life left in him.</p>
    <p class=l>hung by the skin; the body sunk to dust.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones gave chase to acamas on</p>
    <p class=l>o’ertaken neamas by merion bleeds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foot and caught him up just as he was about to mount his chariot;</p>
    <p class=l>pierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he drove a spear through his right shoulder so that he fell</p>
    <p class=l>back from the car he tumbles to the ground:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>headlong from the car, and his eyes were closed in darkness.</p>
    <p class=l>his swimming eyes eternal shades surround.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus speared erymas in the mouth; the bronze point of the</p>
    <p class=l>next erymas was doom’d his fate to feel,<br />his open’d mouth received the cretan steel:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear went clean through it beneath the brain, crashing in among</p>
    <p class=l>beneath the brain the point a passage tore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the white bones and smashing them up.<br />his teeth were all of them<br />knocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream from both his</p>
    <p class=l>crash’d the thin bones, and drown’d the teeth in gore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eyes; it also came gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils, and</p>
    <p class=l>his mouth, his eyes, his nostrils, pour a flood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the darkness of death enfolded him round about.</p>
    <p class=l>he sobs his soul out in the gush of blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did these chieftains of the danaans each of them kill his<br />man.<br />as ravening wolves seize on kids or lambs, fastening on them<br />when they are alone on the hillsides and have strayed from the</p>
    <p class=l>as when the flocks neglected by the swain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>main flock through the carelessness of the shepherd—and when the</p>
    <p class=l>or kids, or lambs, lie scatter’d o’er the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wolves see this they pounce upon them at once because they cannot</p>
    <p class=l>a troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>defend themselves—even so did the danaans now fall on the</p>
    <p class=l>and rend the trembling, unresisting prey:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans, who fled with ill-omened cries in their panic and had no</p>
    <p class=l>thus on the foe the greeks impetuous came;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>more fight left in them.</p>
    <p class=l>troy fled, unmindful of her former fame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile great ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into hector,</p>
    <p class=l>but still at hector godlike ajax aim’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but hector was so skilful that he held his broad shoulders well</p>
    <p class=l>still, pointed at his breast, his javelin flamed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>under cover of his ox-hide shield, ever on the look-out for the</p>
    <p class=l>the trojan chief, experienced in the field,<br />o’er his broad shoulders spread the massy shield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whizzing of the arrows and the heavy thud of the spears.</p>
    <p class=l>observed the storm of darts the grecians pour,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he well</p>
    <p class=l>and on his buckler caught the ringing shower:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>knew that the fortunes of the day had changed, but still stood</p>
    <p class=l>he sees for greece the scale of conquest rise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his ground and tried to protect his comrades.</p>
    <p class=l>yet stops, and turns, and saves his loved allies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when a cloud goes up into heaven from olympus, rising out of a</p>
    <p class=l>as when the hand of jove a tempest forms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>clear sky when jove is brewing a gale—even with such panic</p>
    <p class=l>and rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stricken rout did the trojans now fly, and there was no order in</p>
    <p class=l>dark o’er the fields the ascending vapour flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their going.</p>
    <p class=l>and shades the sun, and blots the golden skies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector’s fleet horses bore him and his armour out of</p>
    <p class=l>so from the ships, along the dusky plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fight, and he left the trojan host penned in by the deep</p>
    <p class=l>dire flight and terror drove the trojan train.<br />even hector fled; through heads of disarray</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trench against their will.</p>
    <p class=l>the fiery coursers forced their lord away:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many a yoke of horses snapped the pole</p>
    <p class=l>while far behind his trojans fall confused;<br />wedged in the trench, in one vast carnage bruised:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of their chariots in the trench and left their master’s car</p>
    <p class=l>chariots on chariots roll: the clashing spokes<br />shock; while the madding steeds break short their yokes.<br />in vain they labour up the steepy mound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>behind them.</p>
    <p class=l>their charioteers lie foaming on the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus gave chase, calling impetuously on the</p>
    <p class=l>fierce on the rear, with shouts patroclus flies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>danaans and full of fury against the trojans, who, being now no</p>
    <p class=l>tumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>longer in a body, filled all the ways with their cries of panic</p>
    <p class=l>thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and rout; the air was darkened with the clouds of dust they</p>
    <p class=l>clouds rise on clouds, and heaven is snatch’d from sight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>raised, and the horses strained every nerve in their flight from</p>
    <p class=l>the affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the tents and ships towards the city.</p>
    <p class=l>scour o’er the fields, and stretch to reach the town.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men</p>
    <p class=l>loud o’er the rout was heard the victor’s cry,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flying in confusion, cheering on his men the while.</p>
    <p class=l>where the war bleeds, and where the thickest die,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariots were</p>
    <p class=l>where horse and arms, and chariots lie o’erthrown,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>being smashed in all directions, and many a man came tumbling</p>
    <p class=l>and bleeding heroes under axles groan.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>down from his own car to fall beneath the wheels of that of</p>
    <p class=l>no stop, no check, the steeds of peleus knew:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus, whose immortal steeds, given by the gods to peleus,</p>
    <p class=l>from bank to bank the immortal coursers flew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sprang over the trench at a bound as they sped onward.</p>
    <p class=l>high-bounding o’er the fosse, the whirling car</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was</p>
    <p class=l>smokes through the ranks, o’ertakes the flying war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>intent on trying to get near hector, for he had set his heart on</p>
    <p class=l>and thunders after hector; hector flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spearing him, but hector’s horses were now hurrying him away.</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus shakes his lance; but fate denies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as</p>
    <p class=l>not with less noise, with less impetuous force,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the whole dark earth bows before some tempest on an autumn day</p>
    <p class=l>the tide of trojans urge their desperate course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when jove rains his hardest to punish men for giving crooked</p>
    <p class=l>than when in autumn jove his fury pours,<br />and earth is loaden with incessant showers;<br />(when guilty mortals break the eternal laws,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>judgement in their courts, and driving justice therefrom without</p>
    <p class=l>or judges, bribed, betray the righteous cause;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heed to the decrees of heaven—all the rivers run full and the</p>
    <p class=l>from their deep beds he bids the rivers rise,<br />and opens all the flood-gates of the skies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>torrents tear many a new channel as they roar headlong from the</p>
    <p class=l>the impetuous torrents from their hills obey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mountains to the dark sea, and it fares ill with the works of</p>
    <p class=l>whole fields are drown’d, and mountains swept away;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men—even such was the stress and strain of the trojan horses in</p>
    <p class=l>loud roars the deluge till it meets the main;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their flight.</p>
    <p class=l>and trembling man sees all his labours vain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him and</p>
    <p class=l>and now the chief (the foremost troops repell’d)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drove them back to the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>back to the ships his destined progress held,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were doing their best to reach</p>
    <p class=l>bore down half troy in his resistless way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the city, but he would not let them, and bore down on them</p>
    <p class=l>and forced the routed ranks to stand the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>between the river and the ships and wall.</p>
    <p class=l>between the space where silver simois flows,<br />where lay the fleets, and where the rampires rose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many a fallen comrade</p>
    <p class=l>all grim in dust and blood patroclus stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did he then avenge.</p>
    <p class=l>and turns the slaughter on the conquering bands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first he hit pronous with a spear on the</p>
    <p class=l>first pronous died beneath his fiery dart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chest where it was exposed near the rim of his shield, and he</p>
    <p class=l>which pierced below the shield his valiant heart.<br />thestor was next, who saw the chief appear,<br />and fell the victim of his coward fear;<br />shrunk up he sat, with wild and haggard eye,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fell heavily to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>nor stood to combat, nor had force to fly;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>next he sprang on thestor son of</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus mark’d him as he shunn’d the war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>enops, who was sitting all huddled up in his chariot, for he had</p>
    <p class=l>and with unmanly tremblings shook the car,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lost his head and the reins had been torn out of his hands.</p>
    <p class=l>and dropp’d the flowing reins.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus went up to him and drove a spear into his right jaw; he</p>
    <p class=l>him ’twixt the jaws,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus hooked him by the teeth and the spear pulled him over the</p>
    <p class=l>the javelin sticks, and from the chariot draws.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rim of his car, as one who sits at the end of some jutting rock</p>
    <p class=l>as on a rock that overhangs the main,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and draws a strong fish out of the sea with a hook and a</p>
    <p class=l>an angler, studious of the line and cane,<br />some mighty fish draws panting to the shore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>line—even so with his spear did he pull thestor all gaping from</p>
    <p class=l>not with less ease the barbed javelin bore<br />the gaping dastard; as the spear was shook,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his chariot; he then threw him down on his face and he died while<br />falling.</p>
    <p class=l>he fell, and life his heartless breast forsook.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this, as erylaus was on coming to attack him, he</p>
    <p class=l>next on eryalus he flies; a stone,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>struck him full on the head with a stone, and his brains were all</p>
    <p class=l>large as a rock, was by his fury thrown:<br />full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battered inside his helmet, whereon he fell headlong to the</p>
    <p class=l>and burst the helm, and cleft the head in two:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ground and the pangs of death took hold upon him.</p>
    <p class=l>prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he laid</p>
    <p class=l>and death involved him with the shades of hell.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>low, one after the other, erymas, amphoterus, epaltes,</p>
    <p class=l>then low in dust epaltes, echius, lie;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tlepolemus, echius son of damastor, pyris, ipheus, euippus and</p>
    <p class=l>ipheas, evippus, polymelus, die;<br />amphoterus and erymas succeed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>polymelus son of argeas.</p>
    <p class=l>and last tlepolemus and pyres bleed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now when sarpedon saw his comrades, men who wore ungirdled</p>
    <p class=l>where’er he moves, the growing slaughters spread<br />in heaps on heaps a monument of dead.<br />when now sarpedon his brave friends beheld</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tunics, being overcome by patroclus son of menoetius, he rebuked</p>
    <p class=l>grovelling in dust, and gasping on the field,<br />with this reproach his flying host he warms:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the lycians saying.</p>
    <p class=l>“oh stain to honour!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“shame on you, where are you flying to?</p>
    <p class=l>oh disgrace to arms!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>show</p>
    <p class=l>forsake, inglorious, the contended plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your mettle; i will myself meet this man in fight and learn who</p>
    <p class=l>this hand unaided shall the war sustain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it is that is so masterful; he has done us much hurt, and has</p>
    <p class=l>the task be mine this hero’s strength to try,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stretched many a brave man upon the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>who mows whole troops, and makes an army fly.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and patroclus, when he</p>
    <p class=l>he spake: and, speaking, leaps from off the car:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saw this, leaped on to the ground also.</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus lights, and sternly waits the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the two then rushed at</p>
    <p class=l>as when two vultures on the mountain’s height</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one another with loud cries like eagle-beaked crook-taloned</p>
    <p class=l>stoop with resounding pinions to the fight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vultures that scream and tear at one another in some high</p>
    <p class=l>they cuff, they tear, they raise a screaming cry;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mountain fastness.</p>
    <p class=l>the desert echoes, and the rocks reply:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of scheming saturn looked down upon them in pity and said</p>
    <p class=l>the warriors thus opposed in arms, engage<br />with equal clamours, and with equal rage.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to juno who was his wife and sister, “alas, that it should be the</p>
    <p class=l>jove view’d the combat: whose event foreseen,<br />he thus bespoke his sister and his queen:<br />“the hour draws on; the destinies ordain,[245]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lot of sarpedon whom i love so dearly to perish by the hand of</p>
    <p class=l>my godlike son shall press the phrygian plain:<br />already on the verge of death he stands,<br />his life is owed to fierce patroclus’ hands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>what passions in a parent’s breast debate!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i am in two minds whether to catch him up out of the</p>
    <p class=l>say, shall i snatch him from impending fate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight and set him down safe and sound in the fertile land of</p>
    <p class=l>and send him safe to lycia, distant far<br />from all the dangers and the toils of war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lycia, or to let him now fall by the hand of the son of</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menoetius.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and juno answered, “most dread son of saturn, what is this that</p>
    <p class=l>then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you are saying?</p>
    <p class=l>“what words are these, o sovereign of the skies!</p>

    <p class=r>would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has<br />long been fated, out of the jaws of death?</p>
    <p class=l>short is the date prescribed to mortal man;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do as you will, but we<br />shall not all of us be of your mind.<br />i say further, and lay my<br />saying to your heart, that if you send sarpedon safely to his own</p>

    <p class=r>however, you are fond of him and pity him, let him indeed fall by</p>
    <p class=l>and murmuring powers condemn their partial jove.<br />give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight;</p>

    <p class=r>the hand of patroclus, but as soon as the life is gone out of</p>
    <p class=l>and when the ascending soul has wing’d her flight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him, send death and sweet sleep to bear him off the field and</p>
    <p class=l>let sleep and death convey, by thy command,</p>

    <p class=r>kinsmen will bury him with mound and pillar, in due honour to the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dead.</p>
    <p class=l>his fame (’tis all the dead can have) shall live.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sire of gods and men assented, but he shed a rain of blood</p>
    <p class=l>she said: the cloud-compeller, overcome,<br />assents to fate, and ratifies the doom.<br />then touch’d with grief, the weeping heavens distill’d<br />a shower of blood o’er all the fatal field:<br />the god, his eyes averting from the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon the earth in honour of his son whom patroclus was about to</p>
    <p class=l>laments his son, predestined to be slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>kill on the rich plain of troy far from his home.</p>
    <p class=l>far from the lycian shores, his happy native reign.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they were now come close to one another patroclus struck</p>
    <p class=l>now met in arms, the combatants appear;<br />each heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thrasydemus, the brave squire of sarpedon, in the lower part of</p>
    <p class=l>from strong patroclus’ hand the javelin fled,<br />and pass’d the groin of valiant thrasymed;<br />the nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the belly, and killed him.</p>
    <p class=l>he falls, and falling bites the bloody plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sarpedon then aimed a spear at</p>
    <p class=l>two sounding darts the lycian leader threw:<br />the first aloof with erring fury flew,<br />the next transpierced achilles’ mortal steed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus and missed him, but he struck the horse pedasus in the</p>
    <p class=l>the generous pedasus of theban breed:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>right shoulder, and it screamed aloud as it lay, groaning in the</p>
    <p class=l>fix’d in the shoulder’s joint, he reel’d around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dust until the life went out of it.</p>
    <p class=l>roll’d in the bloody dust, and paw’d the slippery ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the other two horses began to</p>
    <p class=l>his sudden fall the entangled harness broke;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>plunge; the pole of the chariot cracked and they got entangled in</p>
    <p class=l>each axle crackled, and the chariot shook:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the reins through the fall of the horse that was yoked along with</p>
    <p class=l>when bold automedon, to disengage</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them; but automedon knew what to do; without the loss of a moment</p>
    <p class=l>the starting coursers, and restrain their rage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he drew the keen blade that hung by his sturdy thigh and cut the</p>
    <p class=l>divides the traces with his sword, and freed</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>third horse adrift; whereon the other two righted themselves, and</p>
    <p class=l>the encumbered chariot from the dying steed:<br />the rest move on, obedient to the rein:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pulling hard at the reins again went together into battle.</p>
    <p class=l>the car rolls slowly o’er the dusty plain.<br />the towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sarpedon now took a second aim at patroclus, and again missed</p>
    <p class=l>and first sarpedon whirl’d his weighty lance,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him, the point of the spear passed over his left shoulder without</p>
    <p class=l>which o’er the warrior’s shoulder took its course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hitting him.</p>
    <p class=l>and spent in empty air its dying force.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped</p>
    <p class=l>not so patroclus’ never-erring dart;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not from his hand in vain, for he hit sarpedon just where the</p>
    <p class=l>aim’d at his breast it pierced a mortal part,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>midriff surrounds the ever-beating heart.</p>
    <p class=l>where the strong fibres bind the solid heart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he fell like some oak</p>
    <p class=l>then as the mountain oak, or poplar tall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or silver poplar or tall pine to which woodmen have laid their</p>
    <p class=l>or pine (fit mast for some great admiral)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>axes upon the mountains to make timber for ship-building—even so</p>
    <p class=l>nods to the axe, till with a groaning sound</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did he lie stretched at full length in front of his chariot and</p>
    <p class=l>it sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground,<br />thus fell the king; and laid on earth supine,<br />before his chariot stretch’d his form divine:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses, moaning and clutching at the blood-stained dust.</p>
    <p class=l>he grasp’d the dust distain’d with streaming gore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when</p>
    <p class=l>and, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a lion springs with a bound upon a herd of cattle and fastens on</p>
    <p class=l>so lies a bull beneath the lion’s paws,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a great black bull which dies bellowing in its clutches—even so</p>
    <p class=l>while the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws<br />the trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did the leader of the lycian warriors struggle in death as he</p>
    <p class=l>deep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fell by the hand of patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>then to the leader of the lycian band</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he called on his trusty comrade</p>
    <p class=l>the dying chief address’d his last command;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and said, “glaucus, my brother, hero among heroes, put forth all</p>
    <p class=l>“glaucus, be bold; thy task be first to dare</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your strength, fight with might and main, now if ever quit</p>
    <p class=l>the glorious dangers of destructive war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yourself like a valiant soldier.</p>
    <p class=l>to lead my troops, to combat at their head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first go about among the lycian</p>
    <p class=l>incite the living, and supply the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>captains and bid them fight for sarpedon; then yourself also do</p>
    <p class=l>tell them, i charged them with my latest breath</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battle to save my armour from being taken.</p>
    <p class=l>not unrevenged to bear sarpedon’s death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my name will haunt you</p>
    <p class=l>what grief, what shame, must glaucus undergo,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>henceforth and for ever if the achaeans rob me of my armour now</p>
    <p class=l>if these spoil’d arms adorn a grecian foe!<br />then as a friend, and as a warrior fight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that i have fallen at their ships.</p>
    <p class=l>defend my body, conquer in my right:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do your very utmost and call</p>
    <p class=l>that, taught by great examples, all may try</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all my people together.</p>
    <p class=l>like thee to vanquish, or like me to die.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>death closed his eyes as he spoke.</p>
    <p class=l>he ceased; the fates suppress’d his labouring breath,<br />and his eyes darken’d with the shades of death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus planted his heel on</p>
    <p class=l>the insulting victor with disdain bestrode<br />the prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his breast and drew the spear from his body, whereon his senses</p>
    <p class=l>then drew the weapon from his panting heart,<br />the reeking fibres clinging to the dart;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came out along with it, and he drew out both spear-point and</p>
    <p class=l>from the wide wound gush’d out a stream of blood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sarpedon’s soul at the same time.</p>
    <p class=l>and the soul issued in the purple flood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hard by the myrmidons held his<br />snorting steeds, who were wild with panic at finding themselves</p>
    <p class=l>his flying steeds the myrmidons detain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deserted by their lords.</p>
    <p class=l>unguided now, their mighty master slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glaucus was overcome with grief when he heard what sarpedon said,</p>
    <p class=l>all-impotent of aid, transfix’d with grief,<br />unhappy glaucus heard the dying chief:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for he could not help him.<br />he had to support his arm with his<br />other hand, being in great pain through the wound which teucer’s<br />arrow had given him when teucer was defending the wall as he,</p>
    <p class=l>his painful arm, yet useless with the smart</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glaucus, was assailing it.</p>
    <p class=l>inflicted late by teucer’s deadly dart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore he prayed to far-darting</p>
    <p class=l>supported on his better hand he stay’d:<br />to phœbus then (’twas all he could) he pray’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo saying, “hear me o king from your seat, may be in the rich</p>
    <p class=l>“all-seeing monarch!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>land of lycia, or may be in troy, for in all places you can hear</p>
    <p class=l>whether lycia’s coast,<br />or sacred ilion, thy bright presence boast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the prayer of one who is in distress, as i now am.</p>
    <p class=l>powerful alike to ease the wretch’s smart;<br />o hear me!<br />god of every healing art!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have a</p>
    <p class=l>lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grievous wound; my hand is aching with pain, there is no</p>
    <p class=l>stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>staunching the blood, and my whole arm drags by reason of my</p>
    <p class=l>that thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hurt, so that i cannot grasp my sword nor go among my foes and</p>
    <p class=l>i stand unable to sustain the spear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight them, though our prince, jove’s son sarpedon, is slain.</p>
    <p class=l>and sigh, at distance from the glorious war.<br />low in the dust is great sarpedon laid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove defended not his son, do you, therefore, o king, heal me of</p>
    <p class=l>nor jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid;<br />but thou, o god of health!<br />thy succour lend,<br />to guard the relics of my slaughter’d friend:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my wound, ease my pain and grant me strength both to cheer on the</p>
    <p class=l>for thou, though distant, canst restore my might,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lycians and to fight along with them round the body of him who</p>
    <p class=l>to head my lycians, and support the fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>has fallen.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he pray, and apollo heard his prayer.<br />he eased his pain,</p>
    <p class=l>apollo heard; and, suppliant as he stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>staunched the black blood from the wound, and gave him new</p>
    <p class=l>his heavenly hand restrain’d the flux of blood;<br />he drew the dolours from the wounded part,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strength.</p>
    <p class=l>and breathed a spirit in his rising heart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glaucus perceived this, and was thankful that the</p>
    <p class=l>renew’d by art divine, the hero stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty god had answered his prayer; forthwith, therefore, he went</p>
    <p class=l>and owns the assistance of immortal hands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among the lycian captains, and bade them come to fight about the</p>
    <p class=l>first to the fight his native troops he warms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body of sarpedon.</p>
    <p class=l>then loudly calls on troy’s vindictive arms;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from these he strode on among the trojans to</p>
    <p class=l>with ample strides he stalks from place to place;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>polydamas son of panthous and agenor; he then went in search of</p>
    <p class=l>now fires agenor, now polydamas:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas and hector, and when he had found them he said, “hector,</p>
    <p class=l>æneas next, and hector he accosts;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you have utterly forgotten your allies, who languish here for</p>
    <p class=l>inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts.<br />“what thoughts, regardless chief!<br />thy breast employ?<br />oh too forgetful of the friends of troy!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your sake far from friends and home while you do nothing to</p>
    <p class=l>those generous friends, who, from their country far,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>support them.</p>
    <p class=l>breathe their brave souls out in another’s war.<br />see!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sarpedon leader of the lycian warriors has</p>
    <p class=l>where in dust the great sarpedon lies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fallen—he who was at once the right and might of lycia; mars has</p>
    <p class=l>in action valiant, and in council wise,<br />who guarded right, and kept his people free;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>laid him low by the spear of patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>to all his lycians lost, and lost to thee!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stand by him, my friends,</p>
    <p class=l>stretch’d by patroclus’ arm on yonder plains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and suffer not the myrmidons to strip him of his armour, nor to</p>
    <p class=l>o save from hostile rage his loved remains!<br />ah let not greece his conquer’d trophies boast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>treat his body with contumely in revenge for all the danaans whom<br />we have speared at the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>nor on his corse revenge her heroes lost!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke the trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernable</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke: each leader in his grief partook:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grief; for sarpedon, alien though he was, had been one of the</p>
    <p class=l>troy, at the loss, through all her legions shook.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>main stays of their city, both as having much people with him,</p>
    <p class=l>transfix’d with deep regret, they view o’erthrown</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and himself the foremost among them all.</p>
    <p class=l>at once his country’s pillar, and their own;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>led by hector, who was</p>
    <p class=l>a chief, who led to troy’s beleaguer’d wall<br />a host of heroes, and outshined them all.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>infuriated by the fall of sarpedon, they made instantly for the</p>
    <p class=l>fired, they rush on; first hector seeks the foes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>danaans with all their might, while the undaunted spirit of</p>
    <p class=l>and with superior vengeance greatly glows.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus son of menoetius cheered on the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>but o’er the dead the fierce patroclus stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first he</p>
    <p class=l>and rousing ajax, roused the listening bands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spoke to the two ajaxes, men who needed no bidding.<br />“ajaxes,”<br />said he, “may it now please you to show yourselves the men you</p>
    <p class=l>“heroes, be men; be what you were before;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have always been, or even better—sarpedon is fallen—he who was</p>
    <p class=l>or weigh the great occasion, and be more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first to overleap the wall of the achaeans; let us take the body</p>
    <p class=l>the chief who taught our lofty walls to yield,<br />lies pale in death, extended on the field.<br />to guard his body troy in numbers flies;<br />’tis half the glory to maintain our prize.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and outrage it; let us strip the armour from his shoulders, and</p>
    <p class=l>haste, strip his arms, the slaughter round him spread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>kill his comrades if they try to rescue his body.</p>
    <p class=l>and send the living lycians to the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides,</p>
    <p class=l>the heroes kindle at his fierce command;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, the trojans and lycians on the one hand, and the</p>
    <p class=l>the martial squadrons close on either hand:<br />here troy and lycia charge with loud alarms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>myrmidons and achaeans on the other, strengthened their<br />battalions, and fought desperately about the body of sarpedon,</p>
    <p class=l>thessalia there, and greece, oppose their arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shouting fiercely the while.</p>
    <p class=l>with horrid shouts they circle round the slain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty was the din of their armour</p>
    <p class=l>the clash of armour rings o’er all the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as they came together, and jove shed a thick darkness over the</p>
    <p class=l>great jove, to swell the horrors of the fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight, to increase the toil of the battle over the body of his</p>
    <p class=l>o’er the fierce armies pours pernicious night,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son.</p>
    <p class=l>and round his son confounds the warring hosts,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at first the trojans made some headway against the achaeans, for</p>
    <p class=l>his fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one of the best men among the myrmidons was killed, epeigeus, son</p>
    <p class=l>now greece gives way, and great epigeus falls;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of noble agacles who had erewhile been king in the good city of</p>
    <p class=l>agacleus’ son, from budium’s lofty walls;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>budeum; but presently, having killed a valiant kinsman of his</p>
    <p class=l>who chased for murder thence a suppliant came</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>own, he took refuge with peleus and thetis, who sent him to ilius</p>
    <p class=l>to peleus, and the silver-footed dame;<br />now sent to troy, achilles’ arms to aid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the land of noble steeds to fight the trojans under achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>he pays due vengeance to his kinsman’s shade.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector now struck him on the head with a stone just as he had</p>
    <p class=l>soon as his luckless hand had touch’d the dead,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>caught hold of the body, and his brains inside his helmet were</p>
    <p class=l>a rock’s large fragment thunder’d on his head;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all battered in, so that he fell face foremost upon the body of</p>
    <p class=l>hurl’d by hectorean force it cleft in twain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sarpedon, and there died.</p>
    <p class=l>his shatter’d helm, and stretch’d him o’er the slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus was enraged by the death of</p>
    <p class=l>fierce to the van of fight patroclus came,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his comrade, and sped through the front ranks as swiftly as a</p>
    <p class=l>and, like an eagle darting at his game,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or starlings.</p>
    <p class=l>sprung on the trojan and the lycian band.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so<br />swiftly, o noble knight patroclus, did you make straight for the</p>
    <p class=l>what grief thy heart, what fury urged thy hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lycians and trojans to avenge your comrade.</p>
    <p class=l>o generous greek!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forthwith he struck</p>
    <p class=l>when with full vigour thrown,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sthenelaus the son of ithaemenes on the neck with a stone, and<br />broke the tendons that join it to the head and spine.</p>
    <p class=l>at sthenelaus flew the weighty stone,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this</p>
    <p class=l>which sunk him to the dead: when troy, too near</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector and the front rank of his men gave ground.</p>
    <p class=l>that arm, drew back; and hector learn’d to fear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as far as a man</p>
    <p class=l>far as an able hand a lance can throw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can throw a javelin when competing for some prize, or even in</p>
    <p class=l>or at the lists, or at the fighting foe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battle—so far did the trojans now retreat before the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>so far the trojans from their lines retired;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glaucus, captain of the lycians, was the first to rally them, by</p>
    <p class=l>till glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>killing bathycles son of chalcon who lived in hellas and was the</p>
    <p class=l>then bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage,<br />the only hope of chalcon’s trembling age;<br />wide o’er the land was stretch’d his large domain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>richest man among the myrmidons.</p>
    <p class=l>with stately seats, and riches blest in vain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glaucus turned round suddenly,</p>
    <p class=l>him, bold with youth, and eager to pursue<br />the flying lycians, glaucus met and slew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>just as bathycles who was pursuing him was about to lay hold of<br />him, and drove his spear right into the middle of his chest,</p>
    <p class=l>pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and the fall of so good a</p>
    <p class=l>he fell, and falling made the fields resound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>man filled the achaeans with dismay, while the trojans were</p>
    <p class=l>the achaians sorrow for their heroes slain;<br />with conquering shouts the trojans shake the plain,<br />and crowd to spoil the dead: the greeks oppose;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>exultant, and came up in a body round the corpse.</p>
    <p class=l>an iron circle round the carcase grows.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevertheless<br />the achaeans, mindful of their prowess, bore straight down upon</p>
    <p class=l>then brave laogonus resign’d his breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them.</p>
    <p class=l>despatch’d by merion to the shades of death:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones then killed a helmed warrior of the trojans, laogonus</p>
    <p class=l>on ida’s holy hill he made abode,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of onetor, who was priest of jove of mt.<br />ida, and was<br />honoured by the people as though he were a god.</p>
    <p class=l>the priest of jove, and honour’d like his god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones struck<br />him under the jaw and ear, so that life went out of him and the</p>
    <p class=l>between the jaw and ear the javelin went;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>darkness of death laid hold upon him.</p>
    <p class=l>the soul, exhaling, issued at the vent.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas then aimed a spear<br />at meriones, hoping to hit him under the shield as he was</p>
    <p class=l>his spear æneas at the victor threw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>advancing, but meriones saw it coming and stooped forward to</p>
    <p class=l>who stooping forward from the death withdrew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>avoid it, whereon the spear flew past him and the point stuck in</p>
    <p class=l>the lance hiss’d harmless o’er his covering shield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ground, while the butt-end went on quivering till mars robbed</p>
    <p class=l>and trembling struck, and rooted in the field;<br />there yet scarce spent, it quivers on the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it of its force.<br />the spear, therefore, sped from aeneas’s hand in</p>
    <p class=l>sent by the great æneas’ arm in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vain and fell quivering to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>“swift as thou art (the raging hero cries)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas was angry and said,</p>
    <p class=l>and skill’d in dancing to dispute the prize,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“meriones, you are a good dancer, but if i had hit you my spear</p>
    <p class=l>my spear, the destined passage had it found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would soon have made an end of you.</p>
    <p class=l>had fix’d thy active vigour to the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and meriones answered, “aeneas, for all your bravery, you will</p>
    <p class=l>“o valiant leader of the dardan host!<br />(insulted merion thus retorts the boast)<br />strong as you are, ’tis mortal force you trust,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not be able to make an end of every one who comes against you.</p>
    <p class=l>an arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you are only a mortal like myself, and if i were to hit you in</p>
    <p class=l>and if to this my lance thy fate be given,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the middle of your shield with my spear, however strong and</p>
    <p class=l>vain are thy vaunts; success is still from heaven:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>self-confident you may be, i should soon vanquish you, and you</p>
    <p class=l>this, instant, sends thee down to pluto’s coast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would yield your life to hades of the noble steeds.</p>
    <p class=l>mine is the glory, his thy parting ghost.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this the son of menoetius rebuked him and said, “meriones,</p>
    <p class=l>“o friend (menoetius’ son this answer gave)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hero though you be, you should not speak thus; taunting speeches,</p>
    <p class=l>with words to combat, ill befits the brave;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my good friend, will not make the trojans draw away from the dead</p>
    <p class=l>not empty boasts the sons of troy repel,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body; some of them must go under ground first; blows for battle,</p>
    <p class=l>your swords must plunge them to the shades of hell.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and words for council; fight, therefore, and say nothing.</p>
    <p class=l>to speak, beseems the council; but to dare<br />in glorious action, is the task of war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him.</p>
    <p class=l>this said, patroclus to the battle flies;<br />great merion follows, and new shouts arise:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as</p>
    <p class=l>shields, helmets rattle, as the warriors close;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sound of woodcutters in some forest glade upon the</p>
    <p class=l>and thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows.<br />as through the shrilling vale, or mountain ground,<br />the labours of the woodman’s axe resound;<br />blows following blows are heard re-echoing wide,<br />while crackling forests fall on every side:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mountains—and the thud of their axes is heard afar—even such a</p>
    <p class=l>thus echoed all the fields with loud alarms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>din now rose from earth-clash of bronze armour and of good</p>
    <p class=l>so fell the warriors, and so rung their arms.<br />now great sarpedon on the sandy shore,<br />his heavenly form defaced with dust and gore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ox-hide shields, as men smote each other with their swords and</p>
    <p class=l>and stuck with darts by warring heroes shed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spears pointed at both ends.</p>
    <p class=l>lies undistinguish’d from the vulgar dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a man had need of good eyesight now<br />to know sarpedon, so covered was he from head to foot with spears</p>
    <p class=l>his long-disputed corse the chiefs enclose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and blood and dust.</p>
    <p class=l>on every side the busy combat grows;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men swarmed about the body, as flies that</p>
    <p class=l>thick as beneath some shepherd’s thatch’d abode</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>buzz round the full milk-pails in spring when they are brimming</p>
    <p class=l>(the pails high foaming with a milky flood)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with milk—even so did they gather round sarpedon; nor did jove</p>
    <p class=l>the buzzing flies, a persevering train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>turn his keen eyes away for one moment from the fight, but kept</p>
    <p class=l>incessant swarm, and chased return again.<br />jove view’d the combat with a stern survey,<br />and eyes that flash’d intolerable day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>looking at it all the time, for he was settling how best to kill</p>
    <p class=l>fix’d on the field his sight, his breast debates</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus, and considering whether hector should be allowed to</p>
    <p class=l>the vengeance due, and meditates the fates:<br />whether to urge their prompt effect, and call<br />the force of hector to patroclus’ fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>end him now in the fight round the body of sarpedon, and strip</p>
    <p class=l>this instant see his short-lived trophies won,<br />and stretch him breathless on his slaughter’d son;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him of his armour, or whether he should let him give yet further</p>
    <p class=l>or yet, with many a soul’s untimely flight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trouble to the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>augment the fame and horror of the fight.<br />to crown achilles’ valiant friend with praise</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the end, he deemed it best that the</p>
    <p class=l>at length he dooms; and, that his last of days</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brave squire of achilles son of peleus should drive hector and</p>
    <p class=l>shall set in glory, bids him drive the foe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans back towards the city and take the lives of many.</p>
    <p class=l>nor unattended see the shades below.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first, therefore, he made hector turn fainthearted, whereon he</p>
    <p class=l>then hector’s mind he fills with dire dismay;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mounted his chariot and fled, bidding the other trojans fly also,</p>
    <p class=l>he mounts his car, and calls his hosts away;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for he saw that the scales of jove had turned against him.</p>
    <p class=l>sunk with troy’s heavy fates, he sees decline<br />the scales of jove, and pants with awe divine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neither would the brave lycians stand firm; they were dismayed</p>
    <p class=l>then, nor before, the hardy lycians fled,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they saw their king lying struck to the heart amid a heap of</p>
    <p class=l>and left their monarch with the common dead:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>corpses—for when the son of saturn made the fight wax hot many</p>
    <p class=l>around, in heaps on heaps, a dreadful wall</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had fallen above him.</p>
    <p class=l>of carnage rises, as the heroes fall.<br />(so jove decreed!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans, therefore stripped the</p>
    <p class=l>) at length the greeks obtain<br />the prize contested, and despoil the slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gleaming armour from his shoulders and the brave son of menoetius</p>
    <p class=l>the radiant arms are by patroclus borne;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gave it to his men to take to the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus’ ships the glorious spoils adorn.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then jove lord of the</p>
    <p class=l>then thus to phœbus, in the realms above,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>storm-cloud said to apollo, “dear phoebus, go, i pray you, and</p>
    <p class=l>spoke from his throne the cloud-compelling jove:<br />“descend, my phœbus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>take sarpedon out of range of the weapons; cleanse the black</p>
    <p class=l>on the phrygian plain,<br />and from the fight convey sarpedon slain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>blood from off him, and then bear him a long way off where you</p>
    <p class=l>then bathe his body in the crystal flood,<br />with dust dishonour’d, and deform’d with blood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may wash him in the river, anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe</p>
    <p class=l>o’er all his limbs ambrosial odours shed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him in immortal raiment; this done, commit him to the arms of the</p>
    <p class=l>and with celestial robes adorn the dead.<br />those rites discharged, his sacred corse bequeath</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two fleet messengers, death, and sleep, who will carry him</p>
    <p class=l>to the soft arms of silent sleep and death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>straightway to the rich land of lycia, where his brothers and</p>
    <p class=l>they to his friends the immortal charge shall bear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>kinsmen will inter him, and will raise both mound and pillar to</p>
    <p class=l>his friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his memory, in due honour to the dead.</p>
    <p class=l>what honour mortals after death receive,<br />those unavailing honours we may give!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus he spoke.</p>
    <p class=l>[illustration: ] sleep and death conveying the body of sarpedon to<br />lycia</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo obeyed his father’s saying, and came down</p>
    <p class=l>apollo bows, and from mount ida’s height,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from the heights of ida into the thick of the fight; forthwith he</p>
    <p class=l>swift to the field precipitates his flight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>took sarpedon out of range of the weapons, and then bore him a</p>
    <p class=l>thence from the war the breathless hero bore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>long way off, where he washed him in the river, anointed him with</p>
    <p class=l>veil’d in a cloud, to silver simois’ shore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ambrosia and clothed him in immortal raiment; this done, he</p>
    <p class=l>there bathed his honourable wounds, and dress’d<br />his manly members in the immortal vest;<br />and with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews<br />restores his freshness, and his form renews.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>committed him to the arms of the two fleet messengers, death, and</p>
    <p class=l>then sleep and death, two twins of winged race,<br />of matchless swiftness, but of silent pace,<br />received sarpedon, at the god’s command,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sleep, who presently set him down in the rich land of lycia.</p>
    <p class=l>and in a moment reach’d the lycian land;<br />the corse amidst his weeping friends they laid,<br />where endless honours wait the sacred shade.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile patroclus, with many a shout to his horses and to</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile patroclus pours along the plains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>automedon, pursued the trojans and lycians in the pride and</p>
    <p class=l>with foaming coursers, and with loosen’d reins.<br />fierce on the trojan and the lycian crew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foolishness of his heart.</p>
    <p class=l>ah blind to fate!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had he but obeyed the bidding of the</p>
    <p class=l>thy headlong fury flew:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of peleus, he would have escaped death and have been</p>
    <p class=l>against what fate and powerful jove ordain,<br />vain was thy friend’s command, thy courage vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>scatheless; but the counsels of jove pass man’s understanding; he</p>
    <p class=l>for he, the god, whose counsels uncontroll’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will put even a brave man to flight and snatch victory from his</p>
    <p class=l>dismay the mighty, and confound the bold;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grasp, or again he will set him on to fight, as he now did when</p>
    <p class=l>the god who gives, resumes, and orders all,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he put a high spirit into the heart of patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>he urged thee on, and urged thee on to fall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who then first, and who last, was slain by you, o patroclus, when</p>
    <p class=l>who first, brave hero!<br />by that arm was slain,<br />who last beneath thy vengeance press’d the plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the gods had now called you to meet your doom?</p>
    <p class=l>when heaven itself thy fatal fury led,<br />and call’d to fill the number of the dead?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first adrestus,</p>
    <p class=l>adrestus first; autonous then succeeds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>autonous, echeclus, perimus the son of megas, epistor and</p>
    <p class=l>echeclus follows; next young megas bleeds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>melanippus; after these he killed elasus, mulius, and pylartes.</p>
    <p class=l>epistor, melanippus, bite the ground;<br />the slaughter, elasus and mulius crown’d:<br />then sunk pylartes to eternal night;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these he slew, but the rest saved themselves by flight.</p>
    <p class=l>the rest, dispersing, trust their fates to flight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sons of the achaeans would now have taken troy by the hands<br />of patroclus, for his spear flew in all directions, had not<br />phoebus apollo taken his stand upon the wall to defeat his</p>
    <p class=l>now troy had stoop’d beneath his matchless power,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>purpose and to aid the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>but flaming phœbus kept the sacred tower.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thrice did patroclus charge at an</p>
    <p class=l>thrice at the battlements patroclus strook;[246]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>angle of the high wall, and thrice did apollo beat him back,<br />striking his shield with his own immortal hands.</p>
    <p class=l>his blazing ægis thrice apollo shook;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when patroclus<br />was coming on like a god for yet a fourth time, apollo shouted to</p>
    <p class=l>he tried the fourth; when, bursting from the cloud,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him with an awful voice and said, “draw back, noble patroclus, it</p>
    <p class=l>a more than mortal voice was heard aloud.<br />“patroclus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is not your lot to sack the city of the trojan chieftains, nor</p>
    <p class=l>cease; this heaven-defended wall<br />defies thy lance; not fated yet to fall;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yet will it be that of achilles who is a far better man than you</p>
    <p class=l>thy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand,<br />troy shall not stoop even to achilles’ hand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are.</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>” on hearing this, patroclus withdrew to some distance and</p>
    <p class=l>so spoke the god who darts celestial fires;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>avoided the anger of apollo.</p>
    <p class=l>the greek obeys him, and with awe retires.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile hector was waiting with his horses inside the scaean</p>
    <p class=l>while hector, checking at the scæan gates<br />his panting coursers, in his breast debates,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gates, in doubt whether to drive out again and go on fighting, or</p>
    <p class=l>or in the field his forces to employ,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to call the army inside the gates.</p>
    <p class=l>or draw the troops within the walls of troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he was thus doubting<br />phoebus apollo drew near him in the likeness of a young and lusty</p>
    <p class=l>thus while he thought, beside him phœbus stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>warrior asius, who was hector’s uncle, being own brother to</p>
    <p class=l>in asius’ shape, who reigned by sangar’s flood;<br />(thy brother, hecuba!</p>

    <p class=l>from dymas sprung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the river sangarius; in his likeness jove’s son apollo now spoke</p>
    <p class=l>a valiant warrior, haughty, bold, and young;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to hector saying, “hector, why have you left off fighting?</p>
    <p class=l>thus he accosts him.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it is</p>
    <p class=l>“what a shameful sight!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ill done of you.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if i were as much better a man than you, as i am</p>
    <p class=l>is it hector that forbears the fight?<br />were thine my vigour this successful spear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>worse, you should soon rue your slackness.</p>
    <p class=l>should soon convince thee of so false a fear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drive straight towards</p>
    <p class=l>turn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus, if so be that apollo may grant you a triumph over him,</p>
    <p class=l>and in patroclus’ blood efface thy shame.<br />perhaps apollo shall thy arms succeed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and you may rule him.</p>
    <p class=l>and heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this the god went back into the hurly-burly, and hector bade</p>
    <p class=l>so spoke the inspiring god; then took his flight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cebriones drive again into the fight.<br />apollo passed in among</p>
    <p class=l>and plunged amidst the tumult of the fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them, and struck panic into the argives, while he gave triumph to</p>
    <p class=l>he bids cebrion drive the rapid car;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector and the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>the lash resounds, the coursers rush to war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector let the other danaans alone and</p>
    <p class=l>the god the grecians’ sinking souls depress’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>killed no man, but drove straight at patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>and pour’d swift spirits through each trojan breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus then</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus lights, impatient for the fight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sprang from his chariot to the ground, with a spear in his left<br />hand, and in his right a jagged stone as large as his hand could</p>
    <p class=l>a spear his left, a stone employs his right:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hold.</p>
    <p class=l>with all his nerves he drives it at the foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he stood still and threw it, nor did it go far without</p>
    <p class=l>pointed above, and rough and gross below:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hitting some one; the cast was not in vain, for the stone struck</p>
    <p class=l>the falling ruin crush’d cebrion’s head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cebriones, hector’s charioteer, a bastard son of priam, as he<br />held the reins in his hands.</p>
    <p class=l>the lawless offspring of king priam’s bed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the stone hit him on the forehead<br />and drove his brows into his head for the bone was smashed, and</p>
    <p class=l>his front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish’d wound:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his eyes fell to the ground at his feet.</p>
    <p class=l>the bursting balls drop sightless to the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he dropped dead from his</p>
    <p class=l>the charioteer, while yet he held the rein,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariot as though he were diving, and there was no more life left</p>
    <p class=l>struck from the car, falls headlong on the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in him.</p>
    <p class=l>to the dark shades the soul unwilling glides,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over him did you then vaunt, o knight patroclus, saying,</p>
    <p class=l>while the proud victor thus his fall derides.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“bless my heart, how active he is, and how well he dives.</p>
    <p class=l>“good heaven!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if we</p>
    <p class=l>what active feats yon artist shows!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had been at sea this fellow would have dived from the ship’s side<br />and brought up as many oysters as the whole crew could stomach,</p>
    <p class=l>what skilful divers are our phrygian foes!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even in rough water, for he has dived beautifully off his chariot</p>
    <p class=l>mark with what ease they sink into the sand!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on to the ground.<br />it seems, then, that there are divers also</p>
    <p class=l>pity that all their practice is by land!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among the trojans.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he flung himself on cebriones with the spring, as it</p>
    <p class=l>then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize,<br />to spoil the carcase fierce patroclus flies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were, of a lion that while attacking a stockyard is himself</p>
    <p class=l>swift as a lion, terrible and bold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>struck in the chest, and his courage is his own bane—even so</p>
    <p class=l>that sweeps the field, depopulates the fold;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>furiously, o patroclus, did you then spring upon cebriones.</p>
    <p class=l>pierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector sprang also from his chariot to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>and from his fatal courage finds his bane.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the pair then</p>
    <p class=l>at once bold hector leaping from his car,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fought over the body of cebriones.</p>
    <p class=l>defends the body, and provokes the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as two lions fight fiercely on<br />some high mountain over the body of a stag that they have killed,</p>
    <p class=l>thus for some slaughter’d hind, with equal rage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so did these two mighty warriors, patroclus son of menoetius</p>
    <p class=l>two lordly rulers of the wood engage;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and brave hector, hack and hew at one another over the corpse of</p>
    <p class=l>stung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cebriones.</p>
    <p class=l>and echoing roars rebellow through the shades.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector would not let him go when he had once got him</p>
    <p class=l>stern hector fastens on the warrior’s head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by the head, while patroclus kept fast hold of his feet, and a</p>
    <p class=l>and by the foot patroclus drags the dead:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fierce fight raged between the other danaans and trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>while all around, confusion, rage, and fright,<br />mix the contending hosts in mortal fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as the<br />east and south wind buffet one another when they beat upon some<br />dense forest on the mountains—there is beech and ash and</p>
    <p class=l>so pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spreading cornel; the top of the trees roar as they beat on one</p>
    <p class=l>in the deep bosom of some gloomy wood;<br />leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,<br />the broad oaks crackle, and the sylvans groan;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>another, and one can hear the boughs cracking and breaking—even</p>
    <p class=l>this way and that, the rattling thicket bends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so did the trojans and achaeans spring upon one another and lay</p>
    <p class=l>and the whole forest in one crash descends.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about each other, and neither side would give way.</p>
    <p class=l>not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many a pointed</p>
    <p class=l>in dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear fell to ground and many a winged arrow sped from its</p>
    <p class=l>darts shower’d on darts, now round the carcase ring;<br />now flights of arrows bounding from the string:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bowstring about the body of cebriones; many a great stone,</p>
    <p class=l>stones follow stones; some clatter on the fields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moreover, beat on many a shield as they fought around his body,</p>
    <p class=l>some hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but there he lay in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and</p>
    <p class=l>but where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,<br />sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hugely, heedless of his driving now.</p>
    <p class=l>and, stretch’d in death, forgets the guiding reins!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven the weapons of</p>
    <p class=l>now flaming from the zenith, sol had driven<br />his fervid orb through half the vault of heaven;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>either side were alike deadly, and the people fell; but when he</p>
    <p class=l>while on each host with equal tempests fell<br />the showering darts, and numbers sank to hell.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went down towards the time when men loose their oxen, the</p>
    <p class=l>but when his evening wheels o’erhung the main,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans proved to be beyond all forecast stronger, so that they</p>
    <p class=l>glad conquest rested on the grecian train.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drew cebriones out of range of the darts and tumult of the</p>
    <p class=l>then from amidst the tumult and alarms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans, and stripped the armour from his shoulders.</p>
    <p class=l>they draw the conquer’d corse and radiant arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then</p>
    <p class=l>then rash patroclus with new fury glows,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus sprang like mars with fierce intent and a terrific</p>
    <p class=l>and breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes.<br />thrice on the press like mars himself he flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shout upon the trojans, and thrice did he kill nine men; but as</p>
    <p class=l>and thrice three heroes at each onset slew.<br />there ends thy glory!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was coming on like a god for a time, then, o patroclus, was</p>
    <p class=l>there the fates untwine</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the hour of your end approaching, for phoebus fought you in fell</p>
    <p class=l>the last, black remnant of so bright a line:<br />apollo dreadful stops thy middle way;<br />death calls, and heaven allows no longer day!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>earnest.</p>
    <p class=l>for lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus did not see him as he moved about in the<br />crush, for he was enshrouded in thick darkness, and the god</p>
    <p class=l>the god in dusky clouds enshrined,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>struck him from behind on his back and his broad shoulders with</p>
    <p class=l>approaching dealt a staggering blow behind.<br />the weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the flat of his hand, so that his eyes turned dizzy.</p>
    <p class=l>his eyes flash sparkles, his stunn’d senses reel</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>phoebus</p>
    <p class=l>in giddy darkness; far to distance flung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo beat the helmet from off his head, and it rolled rattling</p>
    <p class=l>his bounding helmet on the champaign rung.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>off under the horses’ feet, where its horse-hair plumes were all<br />begrimed with dust and blood.</p>
    <p class=l>achilles’ plume is stain’d with dust and gore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>never indeed had that helmet fared</p>
    <p class=l>that plume which never stoop’d to earth before;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so before, for it had served to protect the head and comely</p>
    <p class=l>long used, untouch’d, in fighting fields to shine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forehead of the godlike hero achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>and shade the temples of the mad divine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, however, zeus<br />delivered it over to be worn by hector.</p>
    <p class=l>jove dooms it now on hector’s helm to nod;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevertheless the end of<br />hector also was near.</p>
    <p class=l>not long—for fate pursues him, and the god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the bronze-shod spear, so great and so<br />strong, was broken in the hand of patroclus, while his shield</p>
    <p class=l>his spear in shivers falls; his ample shield</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that covered him from head to foot fell to the ground as did also</p>
    <p class=l>drops from his arm: his baldric strows the field:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the band that held it, and apollo undid the fastenings of his</p>
    <p class=l>the corslet his astonish’d breast forsakes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>corslet.</p>
    <p class=l>loose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this his mind became clouded; his limbs failed him, and he</p>
    <p class=l>stupid he stares, and all-assistless stands:<br />such is the force of more than mortal hands!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stood as one dazed; whereon euphorbus son of panthous a</p>
    <p class=l>a dardan youth there was, well known to fame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dardanian, the best spearman of his time, as also the finest</p>
    <p class=l>from panthus sprung, euphorbus was his name;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horseman and fleetest runner, came behind him and struck him in</p>
    <p class=l>famed for the manage of the foaming horse,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the back with a spear, midway between the shoulders.</p>
    <p class=l>skill’d in the dart, and matchless in the course:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this man as<br />soon as ever he had come up with his chariot had dismounted</p>
    <p class=l>full twenty knights he tumbled from the car,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>twenty men, so proficient was he in all the arts of war—he it</p>
    <p class=l>while yet he learn’d his rudiments of war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was, o knight patroclus, that first drove a weapon into you, but</p>
    <p class=l>his venturous spear first drew the hero’s gore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he did not quite overpower you.</p>
    <p class=l>he struck, he wounded, but he durst no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>euphorbus then ran back into the</p>
    <p class=l>nor, though disarm’d, patroclus’ fury stood:<br />but swift withdrew the long-protended wood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>crowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of the wound; he would</p>
    <p class=l>and turn’d him short, and herded in the crowd.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not stand firm and wait for patroclus, unarmed though he now was,</p>
    <p class=l>thus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to attack him; but patroclus unnerved, alike by the blow the god</p>
    <p class=l>wounded, at once, patroclus yields to fear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had given him and by the spear-wound, drew back under cover of</p>
    <p class=l>retires for succour to his social train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his men in fear for his life.</p>
    <p class=l>and flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector on this, seeing him to be</p>
    <p class=l>stern hector, as the bleeding chief he views,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wounded and giving ground, forced his way through the ranks, and</p>
    <p class=l>breaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues:<br />the lance arrests him with a mortal wound;<br />he falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when close up with him struck him in the lower part of the belly<br />with a spear, driving the bronze point right through it, so that</p>
    <p class=l>with him all greece was sunk; that moment all</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he fell heavily to the ground to the great grief of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>her yet-surviving heroes seem’d to fall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when a lion has fought some fierce wild boar and worsted</p>
    <p class=l>so, scorch’d with heat, along the desert score,<br />the roaming lion meets a bristly boar,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him—the two fight furiously upon the mountains over some little</p>
    <p class=l>fast by the spring; they both dispute the flood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fountain at which they would both drink, and the lion has beaten</p>
    <p class=l>with flaming eyes, and jaws besmear’d with blood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the boar till he can hardly breathe—even so did hector son of</p>
    <p class=l>at length the sovereign savage wins the strife;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam take the life of the brave son of menoetius who had killed</p>
    <p class=l>and the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so many, striking him from close at hand, and vaunting over him</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus thus, so many chiefs o’erthrown,<br />so many lives effused, expires his own.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the while.</p>
    <p class=l>as dying now at hector’s feet he lies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“patroclus,” said he, “you deemed that you should sack</p>
    <p class=l>he sternly views him, and triumphant cries:<br />“lie there, patroclus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>our city, rob our trojan women of their freedom, and carry them</p>
    <p class=l>and with thee, the joy</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>off in your ships to your own country.</p>
    <p class=l>thy pride once promised, of subverting troy;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fool; hector and his fleet</p>
    <p class=l>the fancied scenes of ilion wrapt in flames,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses were ever straining their utmost to defend them.</p>
    <p class=l>and thy soft pleasures served with captive dames.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i am</p>
    <p class=l>unthinking man!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foremost of all the trojan warriors to stave the day of bondage</p>
    <p class=l>i fought those towers to free,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from off them; as for you, vultures shall devour you here.</p>
    <p class=l>and guard that beauteous race from lords like thee:<br />but thou a prey to vultures shalt be made;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>poor<br />wretch, achilles with all his bravery availed you nothing; and</p>
    <p class=l>thy own achilles cannot lend thee aid;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yet i ween when you left him he charged you straitly saying,</p>
    <p class=l>though much at parting that great chief might say,<br />and much enjoin thee, this important day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>‘come not back to the ships, knight patroclus, till you have rent</p>
    <p class=l>‘return not, my brave friend (perhaps he said),</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the blood-stained shirt of murderous hector about his body.</p>
    <p class=l>without the bloody arms of hector dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>’ thus</p>
    <p class=l>’</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i ween did he charge you, and your fool’s heart answered him</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, patroclus march’d, and thus he sped.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>‘yea’ within you.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, o knight</p>
    <p class=l>supine, and wildly gazing on the skies,<br />with faint, expiring breath, the chief replies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus: “hector, vaunt as you will, for jove the son of saturn</p>
    <p class=l>“vain boaster!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and apollo have vouchsafed you victory; it is they who have</p>
    <p class=l>cease, and know the powers divine!<br />jove’s and apollo’s is this deed, not thine;<br />to heaven is owed whate’er your own you call,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vanquished me so easily, and they who have stripped the armour</p>
    <p class=l>and heaven itself disarm’d me ere my fall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from my shoulders; had twenty such men as you attacked me, all of</p>
    <p class=l>had twenty mortals, each thy match in might,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them would have fallen before my spear.</p>
    <p class=l>opposed me fairly, they had sunk in fight:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fate and the son of leto<br />have overpowered me, and among mortal men euphorbus; you are</p>
    <p class=l>by fate and phœbus was i first o’erthrown,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yourself third only in the killing of me.</p>
    <p class=l>euphorbus next; the third mean part thy own.<br />but thou, imperious!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i say further, and lay</p>
    <p class=l>hear my latest breath;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my saying to your heart, you too shall live but for a little</p>
    <p class=l>the gods inspire it, and it sounds thy death:<br />insulting man, thou shalt be soon as i;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>season; death and the day of your doom are close upon you, and</p>
    <p class=l>black fate o’erhangs thee, and thy hour draws nigh;<br />even now on life’s last verge i see thee stand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they will lay you low by the hand of achilles son of aeacus.</p>
    <p class=l>i see thee fall, and by achilles’ hand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul</p>
    <p class=l>he faints: the soul unwilling wings her way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>left his body and flitted down to the house of hades, mourning</p>
    <p class=l>(the beauteous body left a load of clay)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>its sad fate and bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its</p>
    <p class=l>flits to the lone, uncomfortable coast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>manhood.</p>
    <p class=l>a naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dead though he was, hector still spoke to him saying,</p>
    <p class=l>then hector pausing, as his eyes he fed<br />on the pale carcase, thus address’d the dead:<br />“from whence this boding speech, the stern decree</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“patroclus, why should you thus foretell my doom?</p>
    <p class=l>of death denounced, or why denounced to me?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who knows but</p>
    <p class=l>why not as well achilles’ fate be given</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles, son of lovely thetis, may be smitten by my spear and</p>
    <p class=l>to hector’s lance?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>die before me?</p>
    <p class=l>who knows the will of heaven?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting his</p>
    <p class=l>pensive he said; then pressing as he lay</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foot upon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its back.</p>
    <p class=l>his breathless bosom, tore the lance away;</p>

    <p class=r>the fight around the body of patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>the seventh battle, for the body of patroclus.<br />—the acts of menelaus.<br />menelaus, upon the death of patroclus, defends his body from the enemy:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brave menelaus son of atreus now came to know that patroclus had</p>
    <p class=l>euphorbus, who attempts it, is slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fallen, and made his way through the front ranks clad in full</p>
    <p class=l>hector advancing, menelaus<br />retires; but soon returns with ajax, and drives him off.<br />this, glaucus</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>armour to bestride him.</p>
    <p class=l>objects to hector as a flight, who thereupon puts on the armour he had<br />won from patroclus, and renews the battle.<br />the greeks give way, till<br />ajax rallies them: æneas sustains the trojans.<br />æneas and hector attempt<br />the chariot of achilles, which is borne off by automedon.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as a cow stands lowing over her first</p>
    <p class=l>the horses of<br />achilles deplore the loss of patroclus: jupiter covers his body with a</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>calf, even so did yellow-haired menelaus bestride patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>thick darkness: the noble prayer of ajax on that occasion.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>menelaus</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>held his round shield and his spear in front of him, resolute to</p>
    <p class=l>sends antilochus to achilles, with the news of patroclus’ death: then<br />returns to the fight, where, though attacked with the utmost fury, he<br />and meriones, assisted by the ajaces, bear off the body to the ships.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>kill any who should dare face him.</p>
    <p class=l>the time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day.<br />the scene<br />lies in the fields before troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but the son of panthous had</p>
    <p class=l>on the cold earth divine patroclus spread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>also noted the body, and came up to menelaus saying, “menelaus,</p>
    <p class=l>lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of atreus, draw back, leave the body, and let the</p>

    <p class=r>to this menelaus answered in great anger “by father jove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>boasting is an ill thing.</p>

    <p class=l>these sons of panthus vent their haughty mind.</p>

    <p class=r>not see out the days of his youth when he made light of me and</p>
    <p class=l>against our arm which rashly he defied,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>withstood me, deeming me the meanest soldier among the danaans.</p>
    <p class=l>vain was his vigour, and as vain his pride.<br />these eyes beheld him on the dust expire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his own feet never bore him back to gladden his wife and parents.</p>

    <p class=r>euphorbus would not listen, and said, “now indeed, menelaus,</p>
    <p class=l>unmoved, euphorbus thus: “that action known,</p>

    <p class=r>as he spoke he struck menelaus full on the shield, but the spear</p>
    <p class=l>swift as the word the missile lance he flings;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did not go through, for the shield turned its point.</p>
    <p class=l>the well-aim’d weapon on the buckler rings,</p>

    <p class=l>but blunted by the brass, innoxious falls.</p>

    <p class=r>then took aim, praying to father jove as he did so; euphorbus was</p>
    <p class=l>on jove the father great atrides calls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drawing back, and menelaus struck him about the roots of his</p>

    <p class=r>throat, leaning his whole weight on the spear, so as to drive it<br />home.</p>
    <p class=l>it pierced his throat, and bent him to the plain;</p>

    <p class=r>the point went clean through his neck, and his armour rang</p>
    <p class=l>wide through the neck appears the grisly wound,</p>

    <p class=r>rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.</p>

    <p class=l>the shining circlets of his golden hair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which was like that of the graces, and his locks so deftly bound</p>
    <p class=l>which even the graces might be proud to wear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in bands of silver and gold, were all bedrabbled with blood.</p>
    <p class=l>instarr’d with gems and gold, bestrow the shore,</p>

    <p class=l>the tender plant, and withers all its shades;<br />it lies uprooted from its genial bed,<br />a lovely ruin now defaced and dead:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strip the fair youth euphorbus of his armour after he had slain</p>
    <p class=l>thus young, thus beautiful, euphorbus lay,<br />while the fierce spartan tore his arms away.</p>

    <p class=r>him.</p>
    <p class=l>proud of his deed, and glorious in the prize,</p>

    <p class=r>gorges on her blood and entrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not phoebus apollo been angry, and in the guise of mentes chief<br />of the cicons incited hector to attack him.</p>
    <p class=l>“forbear (he cried) with fruitless speed to chase</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“hector,” said he,<br />“you are now going after the horses of the noble son of aeacus,</p>
    <p class=l>achilles’ coursers, of ethereal race;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but you will not take them; they cannot be kept in hand and<br />driven by mortal man, save only by achilles, who is son to an</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>immortal mother.</p>
    <p class=l>or stoop to none but great achilles’ hand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile menelaus son of atreus has bestridden</p>
    <p class=l>too long amused with a pursuit so vain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the body of patroclus and killed the noblest of the trojans,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the god then went back into the toil and turmoil, but the soul of</p>
    <p class=l>thus having spoke, apollo wing’d his flight,<br />and mix’d with mortals in the toils of fight:<br />his words infix’d unutterable care<br />deep in great hector’s soul: through all the war</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector was darkened with a cloud of grief; he looked along the</p>
    <p class=l>he darts his anxious eye; and, instant, view’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ranks and saw euphorbus lying on the ground with the blood still</p>
    <p class=l>the breathless hero in his blood imbued,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flowing from his wound, and menelaus stripping him of his armour.</p>
    <p class=l>(forth welling from the wound, as prone he lay)<br />and in the victor’s hands the shining prey.<br />sheath’d in bright arms, through cleaving ranks he flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this he made his way to the front like a flame of fire, clad</p>
    <p class=l>and sends his voice in thunder to the skies:<br />fierce as a flood of flame by vulcan sent,<br />it flew, and fired the nations as it went.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in his gleaming armour, and crying with a loud voice.<br />when the</p>
    <p class=l>atrides from the voice the storm divined,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of atreus heard him, he said to himself in his dismay, “alas!</p>
    <p class=l>and thus explored his own unconquer’d mind:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what shall i do?<br />i may not let the trojans take the armour of<br />patroclus who has fallen fighting on my behalf, lest some danaan<br />who sees me should cry shame upon me.<br />still if for my honour’s<br />sake i fight hector and the trojans single-handed, they will</p>
    <p class=l>“then shall i quit patroclus on the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>prove too many for me, for hector is bringing them up in force.</p>
    <p class=l>slain in my cause, and for my honour slain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>why, however, should i thus hesitate?</p>
    <p class=l>desert the arms, the relics, of my friend?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when a man fights in</p>
    <p class=l>or singly, hector and his troops attend?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>despite of heaven with one whom a god befriends, he will soon rue</p>
    <p class=l>sure where such partial favour heaven bestow’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it.</p>
    <p class=l>to brave the hero were to brave the god:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let no danaan think ill of me if i give place to hector, for</p>
    <p class=l>forgive me, greece, if once i quit the field;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the hand of heaven is with him.</p>
    <p class=l>’tis not to hector, but to heaven i yield.<br />yet, nor the god, nor heaven, should give me fear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yet, if i could find ajax, the</p>
    <p class=l>did but the voice of ajax reach my ear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two of us would fight hector and heaven too, if we might only</p>
    <p class=l>still would we turn, still battle on the plains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>save the body of patroclus for achilles son of peleus.</p>
    <p class=l>and give achilles all that yet remains</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this, of</p>
    <p class=l>of his and our patroclus—” this, no more</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many evils would be the least.</p>
    <p class=l>the time allow’d: troy thicken’d on the shore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>a sable scene!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while he was thus in two minds, the trojans came up to him with</p>
    <p class=l>the terrors hector led.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector at their head; he therefore drew back and left the body,</p>
    <p class=l>slow he recedes, and sighing quits the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>turning about like some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs</p>
    <p class=l>so from the fold the unwilling lion parts,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and men from a stockyard with spears and hue and cry, whereon he</p>
    <p class=l>forced by loud clamours, and a storm of darts;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is daunted and slinks sulkily off—even so did menelaus son of</p>
    <p class=l>he flies indeed, but threatens as he flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus turn and leave the body of patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>with heart indignant and retorted eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when among the body</p>
    <p class=l>now enter’d in the spartan ranks, he turn’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of his men, he looked around for mighty ajax son of telamon, and</p>
    <p class=l>his manly breast, and with new fury burn’d;<br />o’er all the black battalions sent his view,<br />and through the cloud the godlike ajax knew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>presently saw him on the extreme left of the fight, cheering on</p>
    <p class=l>where labouring on the left the warrior stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his men and exhorting them to keep on fighting, for phoebus</p>
    <p class=l>all grim in arms, and cover’d o’er with blood;<br />there breathing courage, where the god of day</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo had spread a great panic among them.</p>
    <p class=l>had sunk each heart with terror and dismay.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he ran up to him and<br />said, “ajax, my good friend, come with me at once to dead</p>
    <p class=l>to him the king: “oh ajax, oh my friend!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus, if so be that we may take the body to achilles—as for</p>
    <p class=l>haste, and patroclus’ loved remains defend:<br />the body to achilles to restore<br />demands our care; alas, we can no more!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his armour, hector already has it.</p>
    <p class=l>for naked now, despoiled of arms, he lies;<br />and hector glories in the dazzling prize.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these words stirred the heart of ajax, and he made his way among<br />the front ranks, menelaus going with him.</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and touch’d his heart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector had stripped</p>
    <p class=l>the raging pair</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus of his armour, and was dragging him away to cut off his</p>
    <p class=l>pierced the thick battle, and provoke the war.</p>

    <p class=r>but ajax</p>
    <p class=l>and doom’d to trojan gods the unhappy dead;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came up with his shield like wall before him, on which hector</p>
    <p class=l>but soon as ajax rear’d his tower-like shield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>withdrew under shelter of his men, and sprang on to his chariot,</p>
    <p class=l>sprung to his car, and measured back the field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>giving the armour over to the trojans to take to the city, as a</p>
    <p class=l>his train to troy the radiant armour bear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great trophy for himself; ajax, therefore, covered the body of</p>
    <p class=l>to stand a trophy of his fame in war.<br />meanwhile great ajax (his broad shield display’d)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus with his broad shield and bestrode him; as a lion</p>
    <p class=l>guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade;<br />and now before, and now behind he stood:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stands over his whelps if hunters have come upon him in a forest</p>
    <p class=l>thus in the centre of some gloomy wood,<br />with many a step, the lioness surrounds</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he is with his little ones—in the pride and fierceness of</p>
    <p class=l>her tawny young, beset by men and hounds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his strength he draws his knit brows down till they cover his</p>
    <p class=l>elate her heart, and rousing all her powers,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eyes—even so did ajax bestride the body of patroclus, and by his</p>
    <p class=l>dark o’er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>side stood menelaus son of atreus, nursing great sorrow in his</p>
    <p class=l>fast by his side the generous spartan glows</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heart.</p>
    <p class=l>with great revenge, and feeds his inward woes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then glaucus son of hippolochus looked fiercely at hector and</p>
    <p class=l>but glaucus, leader of the lycian aids,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rebuked him sternly.</p>
    <p class=l>on hector frowning, thus his flight upbraids:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“hector,” said he, “you make a brave show,</p>
    <p class=l>“where now in hector shall we hector find?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but in fight you are sadly wanting.</p>
    <p class=l>a manly form, without a manly mind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a runaway like yourself has</p>
    <p class=l>is this, o chief!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>no claim to so great a reputation.</p>
    <p class=l>a hero’s boasted fame?<br />how vain, without the merit, is the name!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>think how you may now save</p>
    <p class=l>since battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ<br />what other methods may preserve thy troy:<br />’tis time to try if ilion’s state can stand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your town and citadel by the hands of your own people born in</p>
    <p class=l>by thee alone, nor ask a foreign hand:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ilius; for you will get no lycians to fight for you, seeing what</p>
    <p class=l>mean, empty boast!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thanks they have had for their incessant hardships.</p>
    <p class=l>but shall the lycians stake</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are you</p>
    <p class=l>their lives for you?<br />those lycians you forsake?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>likely, sir, to do anything to help a man of less note, after</p>
    <p class=l>what from thy thankless arms can we expect?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>leaving sarpedon, who was at once your guest and comrade in arms,</p>
    <p class=l>thy friend sarpedon proves thy base neglect;<br />say, shall our slaughter’d bodies guard your walls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to be the spoil and prey of the danaans?</p>
    <p class=l>while unreveng’d the great sarpedon falls?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so long as he lived he<br />did good service both to your city and yourself; yet you had no</p>
    <p class=l>even where he died for troy, you left him there,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stomach to save his body from the dogs.</p>
    <p class=l>a feast for dogs, and all the fowls of air.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if the lycians will</p>
    <p class=l>on my command if any lycian wait,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>listen to me, they will go home and leave troy to its fate.</p>
    <p class=l>hence let him march, and give up troy to fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if</p>
    <p class=l>did such a spirit as the gods impart</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans had any of that daring fearless spirit which lays</p>
    <p class=l>impel one trojan hand or trojan heart,<br />(such as should burn in every soul that draws</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hold of men who are fighting for their country and harassing</p>
    <p class=l>the sword for glory, and his country’s cause)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>those who would attack it, we should soon bear off patroclus into</p>
    <p class=l>even yet our mutual arms we might employ,<br />and drag yon carcase to the walls of troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ilius.</p>
    <p class=l>oh!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>could we get this dead man away and bring him into the</p>
    <p class=l>were patroclus ours, we might obtain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>city of priam, the argives would readily give up the armour of</p>
    <p class=l>sarpedon’s arms and honour’d corse again!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sarpedon, and we should get his body to boot.</p>
    <p class=l>greece with achilles’ friend should be repaid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for he whose squire</p>
    <p class=l>and thus due honours purchased to his shade.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>has been now killed is the foremost man at the ships of the</p>
    <p class=l>but words are vain—let ajax once appear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans—he and his close fighting followers.</p>
    <p class=l>and hector trembles and recedes with fear;<br />thou dar’st not meet the terrors of his eye;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevertheless you</p>
    <p class=l>and lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dared not make a stand against ajax, nor face him, eye to eye,<br />with battle all round you, for he is a braver man than you are.</p>
    <p class=l>already thou prepar’st to fly.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector scowled at him and answered, “glaucus, you should know</p>
    <p class=l>the trojan chief with fix’d resentment eyed<br />the lycian leader, and sedate replied:<br />“say, is it just, my friend, that hector’s ear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>better.</p>
    <p class=l>from such a warrior such a speech should hear?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have held you so far as a man of more understanding</p>
    <p class=l>i deem’d thee once the wisest of thy kind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>than any in all lycia, but now i despise you for saying that i am</p>
    <p class=l>but ill this insult suits a prudent mind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>afraid of ajax.</p>
    <p class=l>i shun great ajax?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i fear neither battle nor the din of chariots,</p>
    <p class=l>i desert my train?<br />’tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain;<br />i joy to mingle where the battle bleeds,<br />and hear the thunder of the sounding steeds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but jove’s will is stronger than ours; jove at one time makes</p>
    <p class=l>but jove’s high will is ever uncontroll’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even a strong man draw back and snatches victory from his grasp,</p>
    <p class=l>the strong he withers, and confounds the bold;<br />now crowns with fame the mighty man, and now</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while at another he will set him on to fight.</p>
    <p class=l>strikes the fresh garland from the victor’s brow!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come hither then,</p>
    <p class=l>come, through yon squadrons let us hew the way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my friend, stand by me and see indeed whether i shall play the<br />coward the whole day through as you say, or whether i shall not</p>
    <p class=l>and thou be witness, if i fear to-day;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stay some even of the boldest danaans from fighting round the</p>
    <p class=l>if yet a greek the sight of hector dread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body of patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>or yet their hero dare defend the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he called loudly on the trojans saying, “trojans,</p>
    <p class=l>then turning to the martial hosts, he cries:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lycians, and dardanians, fighters in close combat, be men, my</p>
    <p class=l>“ye trojans, dardans, lycians, and allies!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>friends, and fight might and main, while i put on the goodly</p>
    <p class=l>be men, my friends, in action as in name,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>armour of achilles, which i took when i killed patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>and yet be mindful of your ancient fame.<br />hector in proud achilles’ arms shall shine,<br />torn from his friend, by right of conquest mine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this hector left the fight, and ran full speed after his men</p>
    <p class=l>he strode along the field, as thus he said:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who were taking the armour of achilles to troy, but had not yet</p>
    <p class=l>(the sable plumage nodded o’er his head:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>got far.</p>
    <p class=l>swift through the spacious plain he sent a look;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>standing for a while apart from the woeful fight, he</p>
    <p class=l>one instant saw, one instant overtook<br />the distant band, that on the sandy shore</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>changed his armour.</p>
    <p class=l>the radiant spoils to sacred ilion bore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his own he sent to the strong city of ilius</p>
    <p class=l>there his own mail unbraced the field bestrow’d;<br />his train to troy convey’d the massy load.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and to the trojans, while he put on the immortal armour of the</p>
    <p class=l>now blazing in the immortal arms he stands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of peleus, which the gods had given to peleus, who in his age</p>
    <p class=l>the work and present of celestial hands;<br />by aged peleus to achilles given,<br />as first to peleus by the court of heaven:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gave it to his son; but the son did not grow old in his father’s</p>
    <p class=l>his father’s arms not long achilles wears,<br />forbid by fate to reach his father’s years.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>armour.</p>
    <p class=l>him, proud in triumph, glittering from afar,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when jove, lord of the storm-cloud, saw hector standing aloof and</p>
    <p class=l>the god whose thunder rends the troubled air</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>arming himself in the armour of the son of peleus, he wagged his</p>
    <p class=l>beheld with pity; as apart he sat,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>head and muttered to himself saying, “a!</p>
    <p class=l>and, conscious, look’d through all the scene of fate.<br />he shook the sacred honours of his head;<br />olympus trembled, and the godhead said;<br />“ah, wretched man!<br />unmindful of thy end!<br />a moment’s glory; and what fates attend!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>poor wretch, you arm in</p>
    <p class=l>in heavenly panoply divinely bright<br />thou stand’st, and armies tremble at thy sight,<br />as at achilles’ self!<br />beneath thy dart</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the armour of a hero, before whom many another trembles, and you</p>
    <p class=l>lies slain the great achilles’ dearer part.<br />thou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>reck nothing of the doom that is already close upon you.</p>
    <p class=l>which once the greatest of mankind had worn.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you have</p>
    <p class=l>yet live!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>killed his comrade so brave and strong, but it was not well that</p>
    <p class=l>i give thee one illustrious day,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you should strip the armour from his head and shoulders.</p>
    <p class=l>a blaze of glory ere thou fad’st away.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i do</p>
    <p class=l>for ah!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>indeed endow you with great might now, but as against this you</p>
    <p class=l>no more andromache shall come</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall not return from battle to lay the armour of the son of</p>
    <p class=l>with joyful tears to welcome hector home;<br />no more officious, with endearing charms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>peleus before andromache.</p>
    <p class=l>from thy tired limbs unbrace pelides’ arms!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of saturn bowed his portentous brows, and hector fitted</p>
    <p class=l>then with his sable brow he gave the nod<br />that seals his word; the sanction of the god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the armour to his body, while terrible mars entered into him, and</p>
    <p class=l>the stubborn arms (by jove’s command disposed)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>filled his whole body with might and valour.</p>
    <p class=l>conform’d spontaneous, and around him closed:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with a shout he</p>
    <p class=l>fill’d with the god, enlarged his members grew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strode in among the allies, and his armour flashed about him so</p>
    <p class=l>through all his veins a sudden vigour flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that he seemed to all of them like the great son of peleus</p>
    <p class=l>the blood in brisker tides began to roll,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>himself.</p>
    <p class=l>and mars himself came rushing on his soul.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he went about among them and cheered them on—mesthles,</p>
    <p class=l>exhorting loud through all the field he strode,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glaucus, medon, thersilochus, asteropaeus, deisenor and</p>
    <p class=l>and look’d, and moved, achilles, or a god.<br />now mesthles, glaucus, medon, he inspires,<br />now phorcys, chromius, and hippothous fires;<br />the great thersilochus like fury found,<br />asteropaeus kindled at the sound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hippothous, phorcys, chromius and ennomus the augur.</p>
    <p class=l>and ennomus, in augury renown’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all these</p>
    <p class=l>“hear, all ye hosts, and hear, unnumber’d bands</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did he exhort saying, “hear me, allies from other cities who are</p>
    <p class=l>of neighbouring nations, or of distant lands!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>here in your thousands, it was not in order to have a crowd about<br />me that i called you hither each from his several city, but that</p>
    <p class=l>’twas not for state we summon’d you so far,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with heart and soul you might defend the wives and little ones of</p>
    <p class=l>to boast our numbers, and the pomp of war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans from the fierce achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>ye came to fight; a valiant foe to chase,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for this do i oppress my</p>
    <p class=l>to save our present, and our future race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>people with your food and the presents that make you rich.</p>
    <p class=l>for this, our wealth, our products, you enjoy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore turn, and charge at the foe, to stand or fall as is the</p>
    <p class=l>and glean the relics of exhausted troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>game of war; whoever shall bring patroclus, dead though he be,</p>
    <p class=l>now then, to conquer or to die prepare;<br />to die or conquer are the terms of war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into the hands of the trojans, and shall make ajax give way</p>
    <p class=l>whatever hand shall win patroclus slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>before him, i will give him one half of the spoils while i keep</p>
    <p class=l>whoe’er shall drag him to the trojan train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the other.</p>
    <p class=l>with hector’s self shall equal honours claim;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he will thus share like honour with myself.</p>
    <p class=l>with hector part the spoil, and share the fame.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had thus spoken they charged full weight upon the danaans</p>
    <p class=l>fired by his words, the troops dismiss their fears,<br />they join, they thicken, they protend their spears;<br />full on the greeks they drive in firm array,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with their spears held out before them, and the hopes of each ran</p>
    <p class=l>and each from ajax hopes the glorious prey:<br />vain hope!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>high that he should force ajax son of telamon to yield up the</p>
    <p class=l>what numbers shall the field o’erspread,<br />what victims perish round the mighty dead!<br />great ajax mark’d the growing storm from far,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body—fools that they were, for he was about to take the lives of</p>
    <p class=l>and thus bespoke his brother of the war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many.</p>
    <p class=l>“our fatal day, alas!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then ajax said to menelaus, “my good friend menelaus, you</p>
    <p class=l>is come, my friend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and i shall hardly come out of this fight alive.</p>

    <p class=l>’tis not this corse alone we guard in vain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>concerned for the body of patroclus, who will shortly become meat</p>
    <p class=l>condemn’d to vultures on the trojan plain;<br />we too must yield: the same sad fate must fall</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the dogs and vultures of troy, than for the safety of my own</p>
    <p class=l>on thee, on me, perhaps, my friend, on all.<br />see what a tempest direful hector spreads,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>head and yours.</p>
    <p class=l>and lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector has wrapped us round in a storm of battle<br />from every quarter, and our destruction seems now certain.</p>

    <p class=r>call</p>
    <p class=l>call on our greeks, if any hear the call,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then upon the princes of the danaans if there is any who can hear</p>

    <p class=r>us.<br />”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus did as he said, and shouted to the danaans for help at</p>
    <p class=l>the warrior raised his voice, and wide around</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the top of his voice.</p>
    <p class=l>the field re-echoed the distressful sound.<br />“o chiefs!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my friends,” he cried, “princes and</p>

    <p class=r>fleet ajax son of oileus heard him and was first to force his way</p>
    <p class=l>oilean ajax first the voice obey’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through the fight and run to help him.</p>
    <p class=l>swift was his pace, and ready was his aid:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>next came idomeneus and</p>
    <p class=l>next him idomeneus, more slow with age,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones his esquire, peer of murderous mars.</p>
    <p class=l>and merion, burning with a hero’s rage.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as for the others<br />that came into the fight after these, who of his own self could</p>
    <p class=l>the long-succeeding numbers who can name?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>name them?</p>
    <p class=l>but all were greeks, and eager all for fame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans with hector at their head charged in a body.</p>
    <p class=l>fierce to the charge great hector led the throng;<br />whole troy embodied rush’d with shouts along.</p>

    <p class=r>as a</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heaven-born river, and the rocks that jut into the sea ring with</p>
    <p class=l>the river trembles to his utmost shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the roar of the breakers that beat and buffet them—even with such</p>
    <p class=l>and distant rocks re-bellow to the roar.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a roar did the trojans come on; but the achaeans in singleness of</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heart stood firm about the son of menoetius, and fenced him with<br />their bronze shields.</p>
    <p class=l>with brazen shields in horrid circle stand.</p>

    <p class=r>jove, moreover, hid the brightness of their</p>
    <p class=l>jove, pouring darkness o’er the mingled fight,</p>

    <p class=r>helmets in a thick cloud, for he had borne no grudge against the</p>

    <p class=r>son of menoetius while he was still alive and squire to the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>descendant of aeacus; therefore he was loth to let him fall a</p>
    <p class=l>dead he protects him with superior care.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>prey to the dogs of his foes the trojans, and urged his comrades</p>

    <p class=r>at first the trojans drove the achaeans back, and they withdrew</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from the dead man daunted.</p>

    <p class=r>the son of peleus alike in stature and prowess, quickly rallied<br />them and made towards the front like a wild boar upon the<br />mountains when he stands at bay in the forest glades and routs<br />the hounds and lusty youths that have attacked him—even so did<br />ajax son of telamon passing easily in among the phalanxes of the</p>

    <p class=r>which none of those could save him who would have gladly done so,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the son of telamon sprang forward and smote him on his</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bronze-cheeked helmet.<br />the plumed headpiece broke about the point</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the weapon, struck at once by the spear and by the strong hand</p>
    <p class=l>the shatter’d crest and horse-hair strow the plain:</p>

    <p class=r>of ajax, so that the bloody brain came oozing out through the</p>

    <p class=r>crest-socket.</p>
    <p class=l>the brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his strength then failed him and he let patroclus’<br />foot drop from his hand, as he fell full length dead upon the</p>
    <p class=l>he drops patroclus’ foot, and o’er him spread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body; thus he died far from the fertile land of larissa, and</p>
    <p class=l>now lies a sad companion of the dead:<br />far from larissa lies, his native air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>never repaid his parents the cost of bringing him up, for his</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>life was cut short early by the spear of mighty ajax.</p>

    <p class=l>once more at ajax hector’s javelin flies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>took aim at ajax with a spear, but he saw it coming and just</p>
    <p class=l>the grecian marking, as it cut the skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>managed to avoid it; the spear passed on and struck schedius son</p>
    <p class=l>shunn’d the descending death; which hissing on,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of noble iphitus, captain of the phoceans, who dwelt in famed</p>
    <p class=l>stretch’d in the dust the great iphytus’ son,<br />schedius the brave, of all the phocian kind<br />the boldest warrior and the noblest mind:<br />in little panope, for strength renown’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>panopeus and reigned over much people; it struck him under the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>middle of the collar-bone the bronze point went right through</p>

    <p class=r>him, coming out at the bottom of his shoulder-blade, and his</p>
    <p class=l>and deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood;<br />in clanging arms the hero fell and all</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>the fields resounded with his weighty fall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax in his turn struck noble phorcys son of phaenops in the<br />middle of the belly as he was bestriding hippothous, and broke</p>
    <p class=l>phorcys, as slain hippothous he defends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the plate of his cuirass; whereon the spear tore out his entrails</p>
    <p class=l>the telamonian lance his belly rends;<br />the hollow armour burst before the stroke,<br />and through the wound the rushing entrails broke:<br />in strong convulsions panting on the sands</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and he clutched the ground in his palm as he fell to earth.</p>
    <p class=l>he lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector and those who were in the front rank then gave ground,</p>
    <p class=l>struck at the sight, recede the trojan train:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while the argives raised a loud cry of triumph, and drew off the<br />bodies of phorcys and hippothous which they stripped presently of<br />their armour.</p>
    <p class=l>the shouting argives strip the heroes slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans would now have been worsted by the brave achaeans and</p>
    <p class=l>and now had troy, by greece compell’d to yield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>driven back to ilius through their own cowardice, while the</p>
    <p class=l>fled to her ramparts, and resign’d the field;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>argives, so great was their courage and endurance, would have</p>
    <p class=l>greece, in her native fortitude elate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achieved a triumph even against the will of jove, if apollo had</p>
    <p class=l>with jove averse, had turn’d the scale of fate:<br />but phœbus urged æneas to the fight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not roused aeneas, in the likeness of periphas son of epytus, an</p>
    <p class=l>he seem’d like aged periphas to sight:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>attendant who had grown old in the service of aeneas’ aged</p>
    <p class=l>(a herald in anchises’ love grown old,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father, and was at all times devoted to him.</p>
    <p class=l>revered for prudence, and with prudence bold.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in his likeness,</p>
    <p class=l>)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then, apollo said, “aeneas, can you not manage, even though</p>
    <p class=l>thus he—“what methods yet, o chief!<br />remain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heaven be against us, to save high ilius?</p>
    <p class=l>to save your troy, though heaven its fall ordain?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have known men, whose</p>
    <p class=l>there have been heroes, who, by virtuous care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>numbers, courage, and self-reliance have saved their people in</p>
    <p class=l>by valour, numbers, and by arts of war,<br />have forced the powers to spare a sinking state,<br />and gain’d at length the glorious odds of fate:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spite of jove, whereas in this case he would much rather give</p>
    <p class=l>but you, when fortune smiles, when jove declares</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>victory to us than to the danaans, if you would only fight</p>
    <p class=l>his partial favour, and assists your wars,<br />your shameful efforts ’gainst yourselves employ,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>instead of being so terribly afraid.</p>
    <p class=l>and force the unwilling god to ruin troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas knew apollo when he looked straight at him, and shouted to</p>
    <p class=l>æneas through the form assumed descries</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector saying, “hector and all other trojans and allies, shame on</p>
    <p class=l>the power conceal’d, and thus to hector cries:<br />“oh lasting shame!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>us if we are beaten by the achaeans and driven back to ilius</p>
    <p class=l>to our own fears a prey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through our own cowardice.</p>
    <p class=l>we seek our ramparts, and desert the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a god has just come up to me and told</p>
    <p class=l>a god, nor is he less, my bosom warms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me that jove the supreme disposer will be with us.<br />therefore let<br />us make for the danaans, that it may go hard with them ere they<br />bear away dead patroclus to the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>and tells me, jove asserts the trojan arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he sprang out far in front of the others, who then</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, and foremost to the combat flew:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rallied and again faced the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the bold example all his hosts pursue.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas speared leiocritus</p>
    <p class=l>then, first, leocritus beneath him bled,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of arisbas, a valiant follower of lycomedes, and lycomedes</p>
    <p class=l>in vain beloved by valiant lycomede;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was moved with pity as he saw him fall; he therefore went close</p>
    <p class=l>who view’d his fall, and, grieving at the chance,<br />swift to revenge it sent his angry lance;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>up, and speared apisaon son of hippasus shepherd of his people in</p>
    <p class=l>the whirling lance, with vigorous force address’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the liver under the midriff, so that he died; he had come from</p>
    <p class=l>descends, and pants in apisaon’s breast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fertile paeonia and was the best man of them all after</p>
    <p class=l>from rich paeonia’s vales the warrior came,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>asteropaeus.</p>
    <p class=l>next thee, asteropeus!<br />in place and fame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>asteropaeus flew forward to avenge him and attack</p>
    <p class=l>asteropeus with grief beheld the slain,<br />and rush’d to combat, but he rush’d in vain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the danaans, but this might no longer be, inasmuch as those about</p>
    <p class=l>indissolubly firm, around the dead,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus were well covered by their shields, and held their</p>
    <p class=l>rank within rank, on buckler buckler spread,<br />and hemm’d with bristled spears, the grecians stood,<br />a brazen bulwark, and an iron wood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spears in front of them, for ajax had given them strict orders</p>
    <p class=l>great ajax eyes them with incessant care,<br />and in an orb contracts the crowded war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that no man was either to give ground, or to stand out before the</p>
    <p class=l>close in their ranks commands to fight or fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>others, but all were to hold well together about the body and</p>
    <p class=l>and stands the centre and the soul of all:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight hand to hand.</p>
    <p class=l>fix’d on the spot they war, and wounded, wound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did huge ajax bid them, and the earth</p>
    <p class=l>a sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ran red with blood as the corpses fell thick on one another alike</p>
    <p class=l>on heaps the greeks, on heaps the trojans bled,<br />and, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on the side of the trojans and allies, and on that of the</p>
    <p class=l>greece, in close order, and collected might,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>danaans; for these last, too, fought no bloodless fight though</p>
    <p class=l>yet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many fewer of them perished, through the care they took to defend</p>
    <p class=l>fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and stand by one another.</p>
    <p class=l>and now it rises, now it sinks by turns.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did they fight as it were a flaming fire; it seemed as</p>
    <p class=l>in one thick darkness all the fight was lost;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>though it had gone hard even with the sun and moon, for they were</p>
    <p class=l>the sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host<br />seem’d as extinct: day ravish’d from their eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hidden over all that part where the bravest heroes were fighting</p>
    <p class=l>and all heaven’s splendours blotted from the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about the dead son of menoetius, whereas the other danaans and</p>
    <p class=l>such o’er patroclus’ body hung the night,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans fought at their ease in full daylight with brilliant</p>
    <p class=l>the rest in sunshine fought, and open light;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sunshine all round them, and there was not a cloud to be seen</p>
    <p class=l>unclouded there, the aerial azure spread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neither on plain nor mountain.</p>
    <p class=l>no vapour rested on the mountain’s head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these last moreover would rest for</p>
    <p class=l>the golden sun pour’d forth a stronger ray,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a while and leave off fighting, for they were some distance apart</p>
    <p class=l>and all the broad expansion flamed with day.<br />dispersed around the plain, by fits they fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and beyond the range of one another’s weapons, whereas those who</p>
    <p class=l>and here and there their scatter’d arrows light:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were in the thick of the fray suffered both from battle and</p>
    <p class=l>but death and darkness o’er the carcase spread,<br />there burn’d the war, and there the mighty bled.<br />meanwhile the sons of nestor, in the rear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>darkness.</p>
    <p class=l>(their fellows routed,) toss the distant spear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all the best of them were being worn out by the great</p>
    <p class=l>and skirmish wide: so nestor gave command,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>weight of their armour, but the two valiant heroes, thrasymedes</p>
    <p class=l>when from the ships he sent the pylian band.<br />the youthful brothers thus for fame contend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and antilochus, had not yet heard of the death of patroclus, and</p>
    <p class=l>nor knew the fortune of achilles’ friend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>believed him to be still alive and leading the van against the<br />trojans; they were keeping themselves in reserve against the</p>
    <p class=l>in thought they view’d him still, with martial joy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>death or rout of their own comrades, for so nestor had ordered</p>
    <p class=l>glorious in arms, and dealing death to troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he sent them from the ships into battle.</p>
    <p class=l>but round the corse the heroes pant for breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus through the livelong day did they wage fierce war, and the</p>
    <p class=l>and thick and heavy grows the work of death:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sweat of their toil rained ever on their legs under them, and on</p>
    <p class=l>o’erlabour’d now, with dust, and sweat, and gore,<br />their knees, their legs, their feet, are covered o’er;<br />drops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their hands and eyes, as they fought over the squire of the fleet</p>
    <p class=l>and carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of peleus.<br />it was as when a man gives a great ox-hide all</p>
    <p class=l>as when a slaughter’d bull’s yet reeking hide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drenched in fat to his men, and bids them stretch it; whereon</p>
    <p class=l>strain’d with full force, and tugg’d from side to side,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they stand round it in a ring and tug till the moisture leaves</p>
    <p class=l>the brawny curriers stretch; and labour o’er</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it, and the fat soaks in for the many that pull at it, and it is</p>
    <p class=l>the extended surface, drunk with fat and gore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>well stretched—even so did the two sides tug the dead body hither</p>
    <p class=l>so tugging round the corse both armies stood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and thither within the compass of but a little space—the trojans</p>
    <p class=l>the mangled body bathed in sweat and blood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>steadfastly set on dragging it into ilius, while the achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>while greeks and ilians equal strength employ,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were no less so on taking it to their ships; and fierce was the<br />fight between them.</p>
    <p class=l>now to the ships to force it, now to troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not mars himself the lord of hosts, nor yet</p>
    <p class=l>not pallas’ self, her breast when fury warms,<br />nor he whose anger sets the world in arms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva, even in their fullest fury could make light of such a<br />battle.</p>
    <p class=l>could blame this scene; such rage, such horror reign’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>such fearful turmoil of men and horses did jove on that day</p>
    <p class=l>such, jove to honour the great dead ordain’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ordain round the body of patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>achilles in his ships at distance lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile achilles did not</p>
    <p class=l>nor knew the fatal fortune of the day;<br />he, yet unconscious of patroclus’ fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>know that he had fallen, for the fight was under the wall of troy<br />a long way off the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>in dust extended under ilion’s wall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he had no idea, therefore, that</p>
    <p class=l>expects him glorious from the conquered plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus was dead, and deemed that he would return alive as soon</p>
    <p class=l>and for his wish’d return prepares in vain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he had gone close up to the gates.<br />he knew that he was not to</p>
    <p class=l>though well he knew, to make proud ilion bend</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sack the city neither with nor without himself, for his mother</p>
    <p class=l>was more than heaven had destined to his friend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had often told him this when he had sat alone with her, and she<br />had informed him of the counsels of great jove.</p>
    <p class=l>perhaps to him: this thetis had reveal’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, however, she</p>
    <p class=l>the rest, in pity to her son, conceal’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had not told him how great a disaster had befallen him in the<br />death of the one who was far dearest to him of all his comrades.<br />the others still kept on charging one another round the body with</p>
    <p class=l>still raged the conflict round the hero dead,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their pointed spears and killing each other.</p>
    <p class=l>and heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then would one say,</p>
    <p class=l>“cursed be the man (even private greeks would say)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my friends, we can never again show our faces at the</p>
    <p class=l>who dares desert this well-disputed day!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships—better, and greatly better, that earth should open and</p>
    <p class=l>first may the cleaving earth before our eyes</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>swallow us here in this place, than that we should let the</p>
    <p class=l>gape wide, and drink our blood for sacrifice;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans have the triumph of bearing off patroclus to their city.</p>
    <p class=l>first perish all, ere haughty troy shall boast<br />we lost patroclus, and our glory lost!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans also on their part spoke to one another saying,</p>
    <p class=l>thus they: while with one voice the trojans said,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“friends, though we fall to a man beside this body, let none</p>
    <p class=l>“grant this day, jove!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shrink from fighting.<br />” with such words did they exhort each</p>
    <p class=l>or heap us on the dead!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>other.</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they fought and fought, and an iron clank rose through the</p>
    <p class=l>then clash their sounding arms; the clangours rise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>void air to the brazen vault of heaven.</p>
    <p class=l>and shake the brazen concave of the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the horses of the</p>
    <p class=l>meantime, at distance from the scene of blood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>descendant of aeacus stood out of the fight and wept when they</p>
    <p class=l>the pensive steeds of great achilles stood:<br />their godlike master slain before their eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heard that their driver had been laid low by the hand of</p>
    <p class=l>they wept, and shared in human miseries.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>murderous hector.</p>
    <p class=l>[248]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>automedon, valiant son of diores, lashed them</p>
    <p class=l>in vain automedon now shakes the rein,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>again and again; many a time did he speak kindly to them, and</p>
    <p class=l>now plies the lash, and soothes and threats in vain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many a time did he upbraid them, but they would neither go back<br />to the ships by the waters of the broad hellespont, nor yet into</p>
    <p class=l>nor to the fight nor hellespont they go,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battle among the achaeans; they stood with their chariot stock</p>
    <p class=l>restive they stood, and obstinate in woe:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>still, as a pillar set over the tomb of some dead man or woman,</p>
    <p class=l>still as a tombstone, never to be moved,<br />on some good man or woman unreproved<br />lays its eternal weight; or fix’d, as stands<br />a marble courser by the sculptor’s hands,<br />placed on the hero’s grave.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and bowed their heads to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>along their face</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hot tears fell from their</p>
    <p class=l>the big round drops coursed down with silent pace,<br />conglobing on the dust.<br />their manes, that late</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eyes as they mourned the loss of their charioteer, and their</p>
    <p class=l>circled their arched necks, and waved in state,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>noble manes drooped all wet from under the yoke-straps on either</p>
    <p class=l>trail’d on the dust beneath the yoke were spread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>side the yoke.</p>
    <p class=l>and prone to earth was hung their languid head:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of saturn saw them and took pity upon their sorrow.</p>
    <p class=l>nor jove disdain’d to cast a pitying look,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>while thus relenting to the steeds he spoke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wagged his head, and muttered to himself, saying, “poor things,</p>
    <p class=l>“unhappy coursers of immortal strain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>why did we give you to king peleus who is a mortal, while you are</p>
    <p class=l>exempt from age, and deathless, now in vain;<br />did we your race on mortal man bestow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yourselves ageless and immortal?</p>
    <p class=l>only, alas!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was it that you might share the<br />sorrows that befall mankind?</p>
    <p class=l>to share in mortal woe?</p>

    <p class=r>hector son of priam shall drive neither you nor your chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>than man more weak, calamitous, and blind?</p>

    <p class=r>will not have it.</p>
    <p class=l>but cease to mourn:<br />for not by you shall priam’s son be borne</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it is enough that he should have the armour</p>
    <p class=l>high on the splendid car: one glorious prize</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over which he vaunts so vainly.</p>
    <p class=l>he rashly boasts: the rest our will denies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>furthermore i will give you</p>
    <p class=l>ourself will swiftness to your nerves impart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strength of heart and limb to bear automedon safely to the ships</p>
    <p class=l>ourself with rising spirits swell your heart.<br />automedon your rapid flight shall bear<br />safe to the navy through the storm of war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from battle, for i shall let the trojans triumph still further,</p>
    <p class=l>for yet ’tis given to troy to ravage o’er</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and go on killing till they reach the ships; whereon night shall</p>
    <p class=l>the field, and spread her slaughters to the shore;<br />the sun shall see her conquer, till his fall</p>

    <p class=r>fall and darkness overshadow the land.</p>
    <p class=l>with sacred darkness shades the face of all.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he breathed heart and strength into the horses so</p>
    <p class=l>he said; and breathing in the immortal horse</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that they shook the dust from out of their manes, and bore their</p>
    <p class=l>excessive spirit, urged them to the course;<br />from their high manes they shake the dust, and bear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariot swiftly into the fight that raged between trojans and</p>
    <p class=l>the kindling chariot through the parted war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans.<br />behind them fought automedon full of sorrow for his</p>
    <p class=l>so flies a vulture through the clamorous train</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>comrade, as a vulture amid a flock of geese.<br />in and out, and here</p>
    <p class=l>of geese, that scream, and scatter round the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and there, full speed he dashed amid the throng of the trojans,</p>
    <p class=l>from danger now with swiftest speed they flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but for all the fury of his pursuit he killed no man, for he</p>
    <p class=l>and now to conquest with like speed pursue;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>could not wield his spear and keep his horses in hand when alone</p>
    <p class=l>sole in the seat the charioteer remains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the chariot; at last, however, a comrade, alcimedon, son of</p>
    <p class=l>now plies the javelin, now directs the reins:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>laerces son of haemon caught sight of him and came up behind his</p>
    <p class=l>him brave alcimedon beheld distress’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>approach’d the chariot, and the chief address’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“automedon,” said he, “what god has put this folly into<br />your heart and robbed you of your right mind, that you fight the</p>
    <p class=l>“what god provokes thee rashly thus to dare,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans in the front rank single-handed?</p>
    <p class=l>alone, unaided, in the thickest war?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he who was your comrade</p>
    <p class=l>alas!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is slain, and hector plumes himself on being armed in the armour</p>
    <p class=l>thy friend is slain, and hector wields</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the descendant of aeacus.</p>
    <p class=l>achilles’ arms triumphant in the fields.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>automedon son of diores answered, “alcimedon, there is no one</p>
    <p class=l>“in happy time (the charioteer replies)<br />the bold alcimedon now greets my eyes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>else who can control and guide the immortal steeds so well as you</p>
    <p class=l>no greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains,<br />or holds their fury in suspended reins:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can, save only patroclus—while he was alive—peer of gods in</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus, while he lived, their rage could tame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>counsel.</p>
    <p class=l>but now patroclus is an empty name!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>take then the whip and reins, while i go down from the</p>
    <p class=l>to thee i yield the seat, to thee resign</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>car and fight.</p>
    <p class=l>the ruling charge: the task of fight be mine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”<br />he said.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alcimedon sprang on to the chariot, and caught up the whip and</p>
    <p class=l>alcimedon, with active heat,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>reins, while automedon leaped from off the car.</p>
    <p class=l>snatches the reins, and vaults into the seat.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when hector saw</p>
    <p class=l>his friend descends.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him he said to aeneas who was near him, “aeneas, counsellor of</p>
    <p class=l>the chief of troy descried,<br />and call’d æneas fighting near his side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the mail-clad trojans, i see the steeds of the fleet son of</p>
    <p class=l>“lo, to my sight, beyond our hope restored,<br />achilles’ car, deserted of its lord!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeacus come into battle with weak hands to drive them.</p>
    <p class=l>the glorious steeds our ready arms invite,<br />scarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i am sure,<br />if you think well, that we might take them; they will not dare</p>
    <p class=l>can such opponents stand when we assail?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>face us if we both attack them.</p>
    <p class=l>unite thy force, my friend, and we prevail.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the valiant son of anchises was of the same mind, and the pair</p>
    <p class=l>the son of venus to the counsel yields;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went right on, with their shoulders covered under shields of</p>
    <p class=l>then o’er their backs they spread their solid shields:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tough dry ox-hide, overlaid with much bronze.</p>
    <p class=l>with brass refulgent the broad surface shined,<br />and thick bull-hides the spacious concave lined.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chromius and aretus</p>
    <p class=l>them chromius follows, aretus succeeds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went also with them, and their hearts beat high with hope that</p>
    <p class=l>each hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds:<br />in vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they might kill the men and capture the horses—fools that they</p>
    <p class=l>in vain advance!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were, for they were not to return scatheless from their meeting</p>
    <p class=l>not fated to return.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with automedon, who prayed to father jove and was forthwith</p>
    <p class=l>unmov’d, automedon attends the fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>filled with courage and strength abounding.</p>
    <p class=l>implores the eternal, and collects his might.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he turned to his</p>
    <p class=l>then turning to his friend, with dauntless mind:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trusty comrade alcimedon and said, “alcimedon, keep your horses</p>
    <p class=l>“oh keep the foaming coursers close behind!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so close up that i may feel their breath upon my back; i doubt</p>
    <p class=l>full on my shoulders let their nostrils blow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that we shall not stay hector son of priam till he has killed us</p>
    <p class=l>for hard the fight, determined is the foe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and mounted behind the horses; he will then either spread panic</p>
    <p class=l>’tis hector comes: and when he seeks the prize,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among the ranks of the achaeans, or himself be killed among the</p>
    <p class=l>war knows no mean; he wins it or he dies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foremost.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this he cried out to the two ajaxes and menelaus, “ajaxes</p>
    <p class=l>then through the field he sends his voice aloud,<br />and calls the ajaces from the warring crowd,<br />with great atrides.<br />“hither turn, (he said,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>captains of the argives, and menelaus, give the dead body over to</p>
    <p class=l>turn where distress demands immediate aid;<br />the dead, encircled by his friends, forego,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them that are best able to defend it, and come to the rescue of</p>
    <p class=l>and save the living from a fiercer foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>us living; for hector and aeneas who are the two best men among</p>
    <p class=l>unhelp’d we stand, unequal to engage</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans, are pressing us hard in the full tide of war.</p>
    <p class=l>the force of hector, and æneas’ rage:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevertheless the issue lies on the lap of heaven, i will</p>
    <p class=l>yet mighty as they are, my force to prove</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore hurl my spear and leave the rest to jove.</p>
    <p class=l>is only mine: the event belongs to jove.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the spear struck the</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>round shield of aretus, and went right through it for the shield</p>
    <p class=l>which pass’d the shield of aretus the young:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stayed it not, so that it was driven through his belt into the</p>
    <p class=l>it pierced his belt, emboss’d with curious art,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lower part of his belly.</p>
    <p class=l>then in the lower belly struck the dart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when some sturdy youth, axe in hand,</p>
    <p class=l>as when a ponderous axe, descending full,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deals his blow behind the horns of an ox and severs the tendons</p>
    <p class=l>cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull:[249]<br />struck ’twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at the back of its neck so that it springs forward and then</p>
    <p class=l>then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drops, even so did aretus give one bound and then fall on his</p>
    <p class=l>thus fell the youth; the air his soul received,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>back the spear quivering in his body till it made an end of him.</p>
    <p class=l>and the spear trembled as his entrails heaved.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector then aimed a spear at automedon but he saw it coming and</p>
    <p class=l>now at automedon the trojan foe<br />discharged his lance; the meditated blow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stooped forward to avoid it, so that it flew past him and the</p>
    <p class=l>stooping, he shunn’d; the javelin idly fled,<br />and hiss’d innoxious o’er the hero’s head;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went on quivering</p>
    <p class=l>deep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>till mars robbed it of its force.</p>
    <p class=l>in long vibrations spent its fury there.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they would then have fought<br />hand to hand with swords had not the two ajaxes forced their way</p>
    <p class=l>with clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through the crowd when they heard their comrade calling, and<br />parted them for all their fury—for hector, aeneas, and chromius</p>
    <p class=l>but each brave ajax heard, and interposed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were afraid and drew back, leaving aretus to lie there struck to</p>
    <p class=l>nor longer hector with his trojans stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the heart.</p>
    <p class=l>but left their slain companion in his blood:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>automedon, peer of fleet mars, then stripped him of</p>
    <p class=l>his arms automedon divests, and cries,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his armour and vaunted over him saying, “i have done little to</p>
    <p class=l>“accept, patroclus, this mean sacrifice:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>assuage my sorrow for the son of menoetius, for the man i have</p>
    <p class=l>thus have i soothed my griefs, and thus have paid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>killed is not so good as he was.</p>
    <p class=l>poor as it is, some offering to thy shade.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he took the blood-stained spoils and laid them upon</p>
    <p class=l>so looks the lion o’er a mangled boar,<br />all grim with rage, and horrible with gore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his chariot; then he mounted the car with his hands and feet all</p>
    <p class=l>high on the chariot at one bound he sprung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>steeped in gore as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull.</p>
    <p class=l>and o’er his seat the bloody trophies hung.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now the fierce groanful fight again raged about patroclus,<br />for minerva came down from heaven and roused its fury by the</p>
    <p class=l>and now minerva from the realms of air</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>command of far-seeing jove, who had changed his mind and sent her</p>
    <p class=l>descends impetuous, and renews the war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to encourage the danaans.</p>
    <p class=l>for, pleased at length the grecian arms to aid,<br />the lord of thunders sent the blue-eyed maid.</p>

    <p class=r>as when jove bends his bright bow in</p>
    <p class=l>as when high jove denouncing future woe,<br />o’er the dark clouds extends his purple bow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heaven in token to mankind either of war or of the chill storms</p>
    <p class=l>(in sign of tempests from the troubled air,<br />or from the rage of man, destructive war,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that stay men from their labour and plague the flocks—even so,</p>
    <p class=l>the drooping cattle dread the impending skies,<br />and from his half-till’d field the labourer flies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wrapped in such radiant raiment, did minerva go in among the host</p>
    <p class=l>in such a form the goddess round her drew</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and speak man by man to each.</p>
    <p class=l>a livid cloud, and to the battle flew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first she took the form and voice</p>
    <p class=l>assuming phœnix’ shape on earth she falls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of phoenix and spoke to menelaus son of atreus, who was standing<br />near her.</p>
    <p class=l>and in his well-known voice to sparta calls:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“menelaus,” said she, “it will be shame and dishonour</p>
    <p class=l>“and lies achilles’ friend, beloved by all,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to you, if dogs tear the noble comrade of achilles under the<br />walls of troy.</p>
    <p class=l>a prey to dogs beneath the trojan wall?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore be staunch, and urge your men to be so</p>
    <p class=l>what shame 'o greece for future times to tell,<br />to thee the greatest in whose cause he fell!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>also.</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>“o chief, o father!<br />(atreus’ son replies)<br />o full of days!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus answered, “phoenix, my good old friend, may minerva</p>
    <p class=l>by long experience wise!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vouchsafe me strength and keep the darts from off me, for so</p>
    <p class=l>what more desires my soul, than here unmoved<br />to guard the body of the man i loved?<br />ah, would minerva send me strength to rear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall i stand by patroclus and defend him; his death has gone to</p>
    <p class=l>this wearied arm, and ward the storm of war!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my heart, but hector is as a raging fire and deals his blows</p>
    <p class=l>but hector, like the rage of fire, we dread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>without ceasing, for jove is now granting him a time of triumph.</p>
    <p class=l>and jove’s own glories blaze around his head!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva was pleased at his having named herself before any of the</p>
    <p class=l>pleased to be first of all the powers address’d,<br />she breathes new vigour in her hero’s breast,<br />and fills with keen revenge, with fell despite,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>other gods.</p>
    <p class=l>desire of blood, and rage, and lust of fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore she put strength into his knees and</p>
    <p class=l>so burns the vengeful hornet (soul all o’er),</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shoulders, and made him as bold as a fly, which, though driven</p>
    <p class=l>repulsed in vain, and thirsty still of gore;<br />(bold son of air and heat) on angry wings</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>off will yet come again and bite if it can, so dearly does it</p>
    <p class=l>untamed, untired, he turns, attacks, and stings.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>love man’s blood—even so bold as this did she make him as he</p>
    <p class=l>fired with like ardour fierce atrides flew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stood over patroclus and threw his spear.</p>
    <p class=l>and sent his soul with every lance he threw.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now there was among the</p>
    <p class=l>there stood a trojan, not unknown to fame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans a man named podes, son of eetion, who was both rich and</p>
    <p class=l>aëtion’s son, and podes was his name:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>valiant.<br />hector held him in the highest honour for he was his</p>
    <p class=l>with riches honour’d, and with courage bless’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>comrade and boon companion; the spear of menelaus struck this man</p>
    <p class=l>by hector loved, his comrade, and his guest;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the girdle just as he had turned in flight, and went right<br />through him.<br />whereon he fell heavily forward, and menelaus son of<br />atreus drew off his body from the trojans into the ranks of his</p>
    <p class=l>through his broad belt the spear a passage found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>own people.</p>
    <p class=l>and, ponderous as he falls, his arms resound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo then went up to hector and spurred him on to fight, in the</p>
    <p class=l>sudden at hector’s side apollo stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>likeness of phaenops son of asius who lived in abydos and was the</p>
    <p class=l>like phaenops, asius’ son, appear’d the god;<br />(asius the great, who held his wealthy reign</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>most favoured of all hector’s guests.</p>
    <p class=l>in fair abydos, by the rolling main.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in his likeness apollo</p>
    <p class=l>)<br />“oh prince!<br />(he cried) oh foremost once in fame!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said, “hector, who of the achaeans will fear you henceforward now</p>
    <p class=l>what grecian now shall tremble at thy name?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that you have quailed before menelaus who has ever been rated</p>
    <p class=l>dost thou at length to menelaus yield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>poorly as a soldier?</p>
    <p class=l>a chief once thought no terror of the field?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yet he has now got a corpse away from the</p>
    <p class=l>yet singly, now, the long-disputed prize</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans single-handed, and has slain your own true comrade, a man</p>
    <p class=l>he bears victorious, while our army flies:<br />by the same arm illustrious podes bled;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brave among the foremost, podes son of eetion.</p>
    <p class=l>the friend of hector, unrevenged, is dead!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a dark cloud of grief fell upon hector as he heard, and he made</p>
    <p class=l>this heard, o’er hector spreads a cloud of woe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his way to the front clad in full armour.</p>
    <p class=l>rage lifts his lance, and drives him on the foe.<br />but now the eternal shook his sable shield,<br />that shaded ide and all the subject field<br />beneath its ample verge.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon the son of</p>
    <p class=l>a rolling cloud</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saturn seized his bright tasselled aegis, and veiled ida in</p>
    <p class=l>involved the mount; the thunder roar’d aloud;<br />the affrighted hills from their foundations nod,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cloud: he sent forth his lightnings and his thunders, and as he</p>
    <p class=l>and blaze beneath the lightnings of the god:<br />at one regard of his all-seeing eye</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shook his aegis he gave victory to the trojans and routed the<br />achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the vanquish’d triumph, and the victors fly.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the panic was begun by peneleos the boeotian, for while keeping</p>
    <p class=l>then trembled greece: the flight peneleus led;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his face turned ever towards the foe he had been hit with a spear</p>
    <p class=l>for as the brave bœotian turn’d his head</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on the upper part of the shoulder; a spear thrown by polydamas<br />had grazed the top of the bone, for polydamas had come up to him</p>
    <p class=l>to face the foe, polydamas drew near,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and struck him from close at hand.</p>
    <p class=l>and razed his shoulder with a shorten’d spear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then hector in close combat</p>
    <p class=l>by hector wounded, leitus quits the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>struck leitus son of noble alectryon in the hand by the wrist,</p>
    <p class=l>pierced through the wrist; and raging with the pain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and disabled him from fighting further.<br />he looked about him in<br />dismay, knowing that never again should he wield spear in battle</p>
    <p class=l>grasps his once formidable lance in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with the trojans.<br />while hector was in pursuit of leitus,</p>
    <p class=l>as hector follow’d, idomen address’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus struck him on the breastplate over his chest near the</p>
    <p class=l>the flaming javelin to his manly breast;<br />the brittle point before his corslet yields;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nipple; but the spear broke in the shaft, and the trojans cheered</p>
    <p class=l>exulting troy with clamour fills the fields:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aloud.</p>
    <p class=l>high on his chariots the cretan stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector then aimed at idomeneus son of deucalion as he was</p>
    <p class=l>the son of priam whirl’d the massive wood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>standing on his chariot, and very narrowly missed him, but the</p>
    <p class=l>but erring from its aim, the impetuous spear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear hit coiranus, a follower and charioteer of meriones who had</p>
    <p class=l>struck to the dust the squire and charioteer</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come with him from lyctus.</p>
    <p class=l>of martial merion: coeranus his name,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus had left the ships on foot</p>
    <p class=l>who left fair lyctus for the fields of fame.<br />on foot bold merion fought; and now laid low,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and would have afforded a great triumph to the trojans if</p>
    <p class=l>had graced the triumphs of his trojan foe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>coiranus had not driven quickly up to him, he therefore brought</p>
    <p class=l>but the brave squire the ready coursers brought,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>life and rescue to idomeneus, but himself fell by the hand of<br />murderous hector.</p>
    <p class=l>and with his life his master’s safety bought.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for hector hit him on the jaw under the ear;</p>
    <p class=l>between his cheek and ear the weapon went,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the end of the spear drove out his teeth and cut his tongue in</p>
    <p class=l>the teeth it shatter’d, and the tongue it rent.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two pieces, so that he fell from his chariot and let the reins<br />fall to the ground.<br />meriones gathered them up from the ground and</p>
    <p class=l>prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>took them into his own hands, then he said to idomeneus, “lay on,</p>
    <p class=l>his dying hand forgets the falling rein:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>till you get back to the ships, for you must see that the day is</p>
    <p class=l>this merion reaches, bending from the car,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>no longer ours.</p>
    <p class=l>and urges to desert the hopeless war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>idomeneus consents; the lash applies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this idomeneus lashed the horses to the ships, for fear had</p>
    <p class=l>and the swift chariot to the navy flies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>taken hold upon him.</p>
    <p class=l>not ajax less the will of heaven descried,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax and menelaus noted how jove had turned the scale in favour</p>
    <p class=l>and conquest shifting to the trojan side,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the trojans, and ajax was first to speak.</p>
    <p class=l>turn’d by the hand of jove.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“alas,” said he,</p>
    <p class=l>then thus begun,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“even a fool may see that father jove is helping the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>to atreus’s seed, the godlike telamon:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all</p>
    <p class=l>“alas!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their weapons strike home; no matter whether it be a brave man or</p>
    <p class=l>who sees not jove’s almighty hand<br />transfers the glory to the trojan band?<br />whether the weak or strong discharge the dart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a coward that hurls them, jove speeds all alike, whereas ours</p>
    <p class=l>he guides each arrow to a grecian heart:<br />not so our spears; incessant though they rain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fall each one of them without effect.</p>
    <p class=l>he suffers every lance to fall in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what, then, will be best</p>
    <p class=l>deserted of the god, yet let us try</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>both as regards rescuing the body, and our return to the joy of</p>
    <p class=l>what human strength and prudence can supply;<br />if yet this honour’d corse, in triumph borne,<br />may glad the fleets that hope not our return,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>our friends who will be grieving as they look hitherwards; for<br />they will make sure that nothing can now check the terrible hands</p>
    <p class=l>who tremble yet, scarce rescued from their fates,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of hector, and that he will fling himself upon our ships.</p>
    <p class=l>and still hear hector thundering at their gates.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i wish</p>
    <p class=l>some hero too must be despatch’d to bear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that some one would go and tell the son of peleus at once, for i</p>
    <p class=l>the mournful message to pelides’ ear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do not think he can have yet heard the sad news that the dearest</p>
    <p class=l>for sure he knows not, distant on the shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of his friends has fallen.</p>
    <p class=l>his friend, his loved patroclus, is no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but i can see not a man among the</p>
    <p class=l>but such a chief i spy not through the host:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans to send, for they and their chariots are alike hidden in</p>
    <p class=l>the men, the steeds, the armies, all are lost</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>darkness.</p>
    <p class=l>in general darkness—lord of earth and air!<br />oh king!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>o father jove, lift this cloud from over the sons of</p>
    <p class=l>oh father!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans; make heaven serene, and let us see; if you will</p>
    <p class=l>hear my humble prayer:<br />dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore;<br />give me to see, and ajax asks no more:<br />if greece must perish, we thy will obey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that we perish, let us fall at any rate by daylight.</p>
    <p class=l>but let us perish in the face of day!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father jove heard him and had compassion upon his tears.</p>
    <p class=l>with tears the hero spoke, and at his prayer</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forthwith he chased away the cloud of darkness, so that the sun</p>
    <p class=l>the god relenting clear’d the clouded air;<br />forth burst the sun with all-enlightening ray;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shone out and all the fighting was revealed.</p>
    <p class=l>the blaze of armour flash’d against the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax then said to</p>
    <p class=l>“now, now, atrides!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus, “look, menelaus, and if antilochus son of nestor be</p>
    <p class=l>cast around thy sight;<br />if yet antilochus survives the fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>still living, send him at once to tell achilles that by far the</p>
    <p class=l>let him to great achilles’ ear convey</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dearest to him of all his comrades has fallen.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>the fatal news”—atrides hastes away.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus heeded his words and went his way as a lion from a<br />stockyard—the lion is tired of attacking the men and hounds, who<br />keep watch the whole night through and will not let him feast on</p>
    <p class=l>so turns the lion from the nightly fold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fat of their herd.</p>
    <p class=l>though high in courage, and with hunger bold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in his lust of meat he makes straight at</p>
    <p class=l>long gall’d by herdsmen, and long vex’d by hounds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them but in vain, for darts from strong hands assail him, and</p>
    <p class=l>stiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds;<br />the darts fly round him from a hundred hands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>burning brands which daunt him for all his hunger, so in the</p>
    <p class=l>and the red terrors of the blazing brands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>morning he slinks sulkily away—even so did menelaus sorely</p>
    <p class=l>till late, reluctant, at the dawn of day<br />sour he departs, and quits the untasted prey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against his will leave patroclus, in great fear lest the achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>so moved atrides from his dangerous place</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should be driven back in rout and let him fall into the hands of</p>
    <p class=l>with weary limbs, but with unwilling pace;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the foe.</p>
    <p class=l>the foe, he fear’d, might yet patroclus gain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he charged meriones and the two ajaxes straitly saying,</p>
    <p class=l>and much admonish’d, much adjured his train:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“ajaxes and meriones, leaders of the argives, now indeed remember</p>
    <p class=l>“o guard these relics to your charge consign’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>how good patroclus was; he was ever courteous while alive, bear</p>
    <p class=l>and bear the merits of the dead in mind;<br />how skill’d he was in each obliging art;<br />the mildest manners, and the gentlest heart:<br />he was, alas!<br />but fate decreed his end,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it in mind now that he is dead.</p>
    <p class=l>in death a hero, as in life a friend!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this menelaus left them, looking round him as keenly as an</p>
    <p class=l>so parts the chief; from rank to rank he flew,<br />and round on all sides sent his piercing view.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eagle, whose sight they say is keener than that of any other</p>
    <p class=l>as the bold bird, endued with sharpest eye</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bird—however high he may be in the heavens, not a hare that runs</p>
    <p class=l>of all that wings the mid aërial sky,<br />the sacred eagle, from his walks above</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can escape him by crouching under bush or thicket, for he will</p>
    <p class=l>looks down, and sees the distant thicket move;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>swoop down upon it and make an end of it—even so, o menelaus, did<br />your keen eyes range round the mighty host of your followers to</p>
    <p class=l>then stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see if you could find the son of nestor still alive.</p>
    <p class=l>snatches his life amid the clouds of air.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>presently</p>
    <p class=l>not with less quickness, his exerted sight</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus saw him on the extreme left of the battle cheering on</p>
    <p class=l>pass’d this and that way, through the ranks of fight:<br />till on the left the chief he sought, he found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his men and exhorting them to fight boldly.</p>
    <p class=l>cheering his men, and spreading deaths around:<br />to him the king: “beloved of jove!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus went up to</p>
    <p class=l>draw near,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him and said, “antilochus, come here and listen to sad news,<br />which i would indeed were untrue.</p>
    <p class=l>for sadder tidings never touch’d thy ear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you must see with your own eyes</p>
    <p class=l>thy eyes have witness’d what a fatal turn!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as for the armour,</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>antilochus was struck with horror.</p>
    <p class=l>the youthful warrior heard with silent woe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for a long time he was<br />speechless; his eyes filled with tears and he could find no</p>
    <p class=l>from his fair eyes the tears began to flow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>utterance, but he did as menelaus had said, and set off running</p>
    <p class=l>big with the mighty grief, he strove to say<br />what sorrow dictates, but no word found way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as soon as he had given his armour to a comrade, laodocus, who</p>
    <p class=l>to brave laodocus his arms he flung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was wheeling his horses round, close beside him.</p>
    <p class=l>who, near him wheeling, drove his steeds along;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus, then, did he run weeping from the field, to carry the bad</p>
    <p class=l>then ran the mournful message to impart,<br />with tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>news to achilles son of peleus.<br />nor were you, o menelaus, minded</p>
    <p class=l>swift fled the youth: nor menelaus stands</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to succour his harassed comrades, when antilochus had left the</p>
    <p class=l>(though sore distress’d) to aid the pylian bands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pylians—and greatly did they miss him—but he sent them noble</p>
    <p class=l>but bids bold thrasymede those troops sustain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thrasymedes, and himself went back to patroclus.<br />he came running</p>
    <p class=l>himself returns to his patroclus slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>up to the two ajaxes and said, “i have sent antilochus to the</p>
    <p class=l>“gone is antilochus (the hero said);</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships to tell achilles, but rage against hector as he may, he</p>
    <p class=l>but hope not, warriors, for achilles’ aid:<br />though fierce his rage, unbounded be his woe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cannot come, for he cannot fight without armour.</p>
    <p class=l>unarm’d, he fights not with the trojan foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what then will</p>
    <p class=l>’tis in our hands alone our hopes remain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be our best plan both as regards rescuing the dead, and our own</p>
    <p class=l>’tis our own vigour must the dead regain,<br />and save ourselves, while with impetuous hate</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>escape from death amid the battle-cries of the trojans?</p>
    <p class=l>troy pours along, and this way rolls our fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax answered, “menelaus, you have said well: do you, then, and</p>
    <p class=l>“’tis well (said ajax), be it then thy care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones stoop down, raise the body, and bear it out of the fray,</p>
    <p class=l>with merion’s aid, the weighty corse to rear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while we two behind you keep off hector and the trojans, one in</p>
    <p class=l>myself, and my bold brother will sustain<br />the shock of hector and his charging train:<br />nor fear we armies, fighting side by side;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heart as in name, and long used to fighting side by side with one</p>
    <p class=l>what troy can dare, we have already tried,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>another.</p>
    <p class=l>have tried it, and have stood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>” the hero said.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this menelaus and meriones took the dead man in their arms and<br />lifted him high aloft with a great effort.</p>
    <p class=l>high from the ground the warriors heave the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojan host raised</p>
    <p class=l>a general clamour rises at the sight:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a hue and cry behind them when they saw the achaeans bearing the</p>
    <p class=l>loud shout the trojans, and renew the fight.<br />not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body away, and flew after them like hounds attacking a wounded</p>
    <p class=l>with rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood,<br />voracious hounds, that many a length before</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>boar at the loo of a band of young huntsmen.</p>
    <p class=l>their furious hunters, drive the wounded boar;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for a while the<br />hounds fly at him as though they would tear him in pieces, but</p>
    <p class=l>but if the savage turns his glaring eye,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now and again he turns on them in a fury, scaring and scattering</p>
    <p class=l>they howl aloof, and round the forest fly.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them in all directions—even so did the trojans for a while charge</p>
    <p class=l>thus on retreating greece the trojans pour,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in a body, striking with sword and with spears pointed at both</p>
    <p class=l>wave their thick falchions, and their javelins shower:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ends, but when the two ajaxes faced them and stood at bay,</p>
    <p class=l>but ajax turning, to their fears they yield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they would turn pale and no man dared press on to fight further</p>
    <p class=l>all pale they tremble and forsake the field.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about the dead.<br />in this wise did the two heroes strain every nerve to bear the</p>
    <p class=l>while thus aloft the hero’s corse they bear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body to the ships out of the fight.<br />the battle raged round them</p>
    <p class=l>behind them rages all the storm of war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like fierce flames that when once kindled spread like wildfire</p>
    <p class=l>confusion, tumult, horror, o’er the throng<br />of men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along:<br />less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over a city, and the houses fall in the glare of its burning—even</p>
    <p class=l>to whelm some city under waves of fire;<br />now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes,<br />now crack the blazing temples of the gods;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>such was the roar and tramp of men and horses that pursued them</p>
    <p class=l>the rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as they bore patroclus from the field.</p>
    <p class=l>and sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles.<br />the heroes sweat beneath their honour’d load:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or as mules that put forth</p>
    <p class=l>as when two mules, along the rugged road,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all their strength to draw some beam or great piece of ship’s</p>
    <p class=l>from the steep mountain with exerted strength<br />drag some vast beam, or mast’s unwieldy length;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>timber down a rough mountain-track, and they pant and sweat as</p>
    <p class=l>inly they groan, big drops of sweat distil,<br />the enormous timber lumbering down the hill:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they go—even so did menelaus and meriones pant and sweat as they bore the</p>
    <p class=l>so these—behind, the bulk of ajax stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body of patroclus.<br />behind them the two ajaxes held stoutly out.</p>
    <p class=l>and breaks the torrent of the rushing bands.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as some wooded mountain-spur that stretches across a plain will</p>
    <p class=l>thus when a river swell’d with sudden rains</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>turn water and check the flow even of a great river, nor is there</p>
    <p class=l>spreads his broad waters o’er the level plains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>any stream strong enough to break through it—even so did the two</p>
    <p class=l>some interposing hill the stream divides,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajaxes face the trojans and stem the tide of their fighting</p>
    <p class=l>and breaks its force, and turns the winding tides.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>though they kept pouring on towards them and foremost among them</p>
    <p class=l>still close they follow, close the rear engage;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all was aeneas son of anchises with valiant hector.</p>
    <p class=l>æneas storms, and hector foams with rage:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as a flock of</p>
    <p class=l>while greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains,<br />wedged in one body, like a flight of cranes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>daws or starlings fall to screaming and chattering when they see<br />a falcon, foe to all small birds, come soaring near them, even so</p>
    <p class=l>that shriek incessant, while the falcon, hung</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did the achaean youth raise a babel of cries as they fled before</p>
    <p class=l>high on poised pinions, threats their callow young.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas and hector, unmindful of their former prowess.</p>
    <p class=l>so from the trojan chiefs the grecians fly,<br />such the wild terror, and the mingled cry:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the rout</p>
    <p class=l>within, without the trench, and all the way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the danaans much goodly armour fell round about the trench,</p>
    <p class=l>strow’d in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay;<br />such horror jove impress’d!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and of fighting there was no end.</p>
    <p class=l>yet still proceeds<br />the work of death, and still the battle bleeds.</p>

    <p class=r>thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire.</p>
    <p class=l>thus like the rage of fire the combat burns,[250]<br />and now it rises, now it sinks by turns.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile, where hellespont’s broad waters flow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fleet runner antilochus, who had been sent as messenger, reached</p>
    <p class=l>stood nestor’s son, the messenger of woe:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles, and found him sitting by his tall ships and boding that</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which was indeed too surely true.</p>
    <p class=l>rose in sad prospect to his boding mind.</p>

    <p class=l>ordain’d, to sink me with the weight of woe?</p>

    <p class=r>spoke, saying that while i was yet alive the bravest of the</p>

    <p class=l>thus while he thinks, antilochus appears,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>told his sad tale, weeping bitterly the while.</p>
    <p class=l>and tells the melancholy tale with tears.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a dark cloud of grief fell upon achilles as he listened.</p>
    <p class=l>a sudden horror shot through all the chief,<br />and wrapp’d his senses in the cloud of grief;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he<br />filled both hands with dust from off the ground, and poured it</p>
    <p class=l>cast on the ground, with furious hands he spread</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over his head, disfiguring his comely face, and letting the</p>

    <p class=r>refuse settle over his shirt so fair and new.</p>
    <p class=l>his purple garments, and his golden hairs,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he flung himself</p>
    <p class=l>those he deforms with dust, and these he tears;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>down all huge and hugely at full length, and tore his hair with</p>
    <p class=l>on the hard soil his groaning breast he threw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his hands.</p>
    <p class=l>and roll’d and grovell’d, as to earth he grew.</p>

    <p class=r>captive screamed aloud for grief, beating their breasts, and with</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their limbs failing them for sorrow.</p>
    <p class=l>beat their white breasts, and fainted on the ground:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>antilochus bent over him the</p>
    <p class=l>while nestor’s son sustains a manlier part,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while, weeping and holding both his hands as he lay groaning for</p>

    <p class=r>nevertheless i will go, that i may see my dear son and</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weeping</p>
    <p class=l>she said, and left the caverns of the main,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after, and the waves opened a path before them.</p>
    <p class=l>all bathed in tears; the melancholy train</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they reached</p>
    <p class=l>attend her way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the rich plain of troy, they came up out of the sea in a long</p>
    <p class=l>wide-opening part the tides,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>line on to the sands, at the place where the ships of the</p>
    <p class=l>while the long pomp the silver wave divides.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>myrmidons were drawn up in close order round the tents of</p>
    <p class=l>approaching now, they touch’d the trojan land;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>then, two by two, ascended up the strand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his mother went up to him as he lay groaning; she laid</p>
    <p class=l>the immortal mother, standing close beside<br />her mournful offspring, to his sighs replied;<br />along the coast their mingled clamours ran,<br />and thus the silver-footed dame began:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her hand upon his head and spoke piteously, saying, “my son, why</p>
    <p class=l>“why mourns my son?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are you thus weeping?</p>
    <p class=l>thy late preferr’d request</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what sorrow has now befallen you?</p>
    <p class=l>the god has granted, and the greeks distress’d:<br />why mourns my son?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tell me;</p>
    <p class=l>thy anguish let me share,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hide it not from me.</p>
    <p class=l>reveal the cause, and trust a parent’s care.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>surely jove has granted you the prayer you</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>made him, when you lifted up your hands and besought him that the<br />achaeans might all of them be pent up at their ships, and rue it</p>
    <p class=l>he, deeply groaning—“to this cureless grief,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bitterly in that you were no longer with them.</p>
    <p class=l>not even the thunderer’s favour brings relief.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus—ah!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles groaned and answered, “mother, olympian jove has indeed</p>
    <p class=l>—say, goddess, can i boast</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vouchsafed me the fulfilment of my prayer, but what boots it to</p>
    <p class=l>a pleasure now?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me, seeing that my dear comrade patroclus has fallen—he whom i</p>
    <p class=l>revenge itself is lost;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>valued more than all others, and loved as dearly as my own life?</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus, loved of all my martial train,<br />beyond mankind, beyond myself is slain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have lost him; aye, and hector when he had killed him stripped<br />the wondrous armour, so glorious to behold, which the gods gave</p>
    <p class=l>lost are those arms the gods themselves bestow’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to peleus when they laid you in the couch of a mortal man.</p>
    <p class=l>on peleus; hector bears the glorious load.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would</p>
    <p class=l>cursed be that day, when all the powers above</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that you were still dwelling among the immortal sea-nymphs, and</p>
    <p class=l>thy charms submitted to a mortal love:<br />o hadst thou still, a sister of the main,<br />pursued the pleasures of the watery reign:<br />and happier peleus, less ambitious, led</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that peleus had taken to himself some mortal bride.</p>
    <p class=l>a mortal beauty to his equal bed!<br />ere the sad fruit of thy unhappy womb<br />had caused such sorrows past, and woes to come.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for now you</p>
    <p class=l>for soon, alas!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall have grief infinite by reason of the death of that son whom</p>
    <p class=l>that wretched offspring slain,<br />new woes, new sorrows, shall create again.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you can never welcome home—nay, i will not live nor go about</p>
    <p class=l>’tis not in fate the alternate now to give;<br />patroclus dead, achilles hates to live.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among mankind unless hector fall by my spear, and thus pay me for</p>
    <p class=l>let me revenge it on proud hector’s heart,<br />let his last spirit smoke upon my dart;<br />on these conditions will i breathe: till then,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>having slain patroclus son of menoetius.</p>
    <p class=l>i blush to walk among the race of men.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thetis wept and answered, “then, my son, is your end near at</p>
    <p class=l>a flood of tears, at this, the goddess shed:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hand—for your own death awaits you full soon after that of</p>
    <p class=l>“ah then, i see thee dying, see thee dead!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector.</p>
    <p class=l>when hector falls, thou diest.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”<br />then said achilles in his great grief, “i would die here and now,</p>
    <p class=l>”—“let hector die,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in that i could not save my comrade.</p>
    <p class=l>and let me fall!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he has fallen far from home,</p>
    <p class=l>(achilles made reply)<br />far lies patroclus from his native plain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and in his hour of need my hand was not there to help him.</p>
    <p class=l>he fell, and falling, wish’d my aid in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what</p>
    <p class=l>ah then, since from this miserable day</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is there for me?<br />return to my own land i shall not, and i have</p>
    <p class=l>i cast all hope of my return away;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brought no saving neither to patroclus nor to my other comrades</p>
    <p class=l>since, unrevenged, a hundred ghosts demand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of whom so many have been slain by mighty hector; i stay here by</p>
    <p class=l>the fate of hector from achilles’ hand;<br />since here, for brutal courage far renown’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my ships a bootless burden upon the earth, i, who in fight have</p>
    <p class=l>i live an idle burden to the ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>no peer among the achaeans, though in council there are better</p>
    <p class=l>(others in council famed for nobler skill,<br />more useful to preserve, than i to kill,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>than i.</p>
    <p class=l>let me—but oh!<br />ye gracious powers above!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, perish strife both from among gods and men,<br />and anger, wherein even a righteous man will harden his</p>
    <p class=l>wrath and revenge from men and gods remove:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heart—which rises up in the soul of a man like smoke, and the</p>
    <p class=l>far, far too dear to every mortal breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>taste thereof is sweeter than drops of honey.</p>
    <p class=l>sweet to the soul, as honey to the taste:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so has</p>
    <p class=l>gathering like vapours of a noxious kind</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon angered me.</p>
    <p class=l>from fiery blood, and darkening all the mind.<br />me agamemnon urged to deadly hate;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and yet—so be it, for it is over; i will<br />force my soul into subjection as i needs must; i will go; i will</p>
    <p class=l>’tis past—i quell it; i resign to fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pursue hector who has slain him whom i loved so dearly, and will</p>
    <p class=l>yes—i will meet the murderer of my friend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then abide my doom when it may please jove and the other gods to</p>
    <p class=l>or (if the gods ordain it) meet my end.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>send it.</p>
    <p class=l>the stroke of fate the strongest cannot shun:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even hercules, the best beloved of jove—even he could</p>
    <p class=l>the great alcides, jove’s unequall’d son,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not escape the hand of death, but fate and juno’s fierce anger</p>
    <p class=l>to juno’s hate, at length resign’d his breath,<br />and sunk the victim of all-conquering death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>laid him low, as i too shall lie when i am dead if a like doom</p>
    <p class=l>so shall achilles fall!<br />stretch’d pale and dead,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>awaits me.</p>
    <p class=l>no more the grecian hope, or trojan dread!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>till then i will win fame, and will bid trojan and</p>
    <p class=l>let me, this instant, rush into the fields,<br />and reap what glory life’s short harvest yields.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dardanian women wring tears from their tender cheeks with both</p>
    <p class=l>shall i not force some widow’d dame to tear<br />with frantic hands her long dishevell’d hair?<br />shall i not force her breast to heave with sighs,<br />and the soft tears to trickle from her eyes?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their hands in the grievousness of their great sorrow; thus shall</p>
    <p class=l>yes, i shall give the fair those mournful charms—</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they know that he who has held aloof so long will hold aloof no</p>
    <p class=l>in vain you hold me—hence!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>longer.</p>
    <p class=l>my arms!<br />my arms!<br />—</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hold me not back, therefore, in the love you bear me, for</p>
    <p class=l>soon shall the sanguine torrent spread so wide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you shall not move me.</p>
    <p class=l>that all shall know achilles swells the tide.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then silver-footed thetis answered, “my son, what you have said</p>
    <p class=l>“my son (coerulean thetis made reply,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is true.</p>
    <p class=l>to fate submitting with a secret sigh,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it is well to save your comrades from destruction, but</p>
    <p class=l>the host to succour, and thy friends to save,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your armour is in the hands of the trojans; hector bears it in</p>

    <p class=r>triumph upon his own shoulders.</p>
    <p class=l>thy radiant arms the trojan foe detains.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>full well i know that his vaunt</p>
    <p class=l>insulting hector bears the spoils on high,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall not be lasting, for his end is close at hand; go not,</p>
    <p class=l>but vainly glories, for his fate is nigh.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>however, into the press of battle till you see me return hither;</p>
    <p class=l>yet, yet awhile thy generous ardour stay;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to-morrow at break of day i shall be here, and will bring you</p>
    <p class=l>assured, i meet thee at the dawn of day,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>goodly armour from king vulcan.</p>
    <p class=l>charged with refulgent arms (a glorious load),<br />vulcanian arms, the labour of a god.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said</p>
    <p class=l>then turning to the daughters of the main,<br />the goddess thus dismiss’d her azure train:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to the sea-nymphs her sisters, “dive into the bosom of the sea</p>
    <p class=l>“ye sister nereids!<br />to your deeps descend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and go to the house of the old sea-god my father.</p>
    <p class=l>haste, and our father’s sacred seat attend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tell him<br />everything; as for me, i will go to the cunning workman vulcan on</p>
    <p class=l>i go to find the architect divine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>high olympus, and ask him to provide my son with a suit of<br />splendid armour.</p>
    <p class=l>where vast olympus’ starry summits shine:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>so tell our hoary sire”—this charge she gave:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when she had so said, they dived forthwith beneath the waves,</p>
    <p class=l>the sea-green sisters plunge beneath the wave:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while silver-footed thetis went her way that she might bring the</p>
    <p class=l>thetis once more ascends the bless’d abodes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>armour for her son.</p>
    <p class=l>and treads the brazen threshold of the gods.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to olympus, and</p>
    <p class=l>[illustration: ] thetis ordering the nereids to descend into the sea</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the achaeans were flying with loud cries before</p>
    <p class=l>and now the greeks from furious hector’s force,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>murderous hector till they reached the ships and the hellespont,</p>
    <p class=l>urge to broad hellespont their headlong course;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and they could not draw the body of mars’s servant patroclus out</p>
    <p class=l>nor yet their chiefs patroclus’ body bore</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of reach of the weapons that were showered upon him, for hector</p>
    <p class=l>safe through the tempest to the tented shore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of priam with his host and horsemen had again caught up to</p>
    <p class=l>the horse, the foot, with equal fury join’d,<br />pour’d on the rear, and thunder’d close behind:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him like the flame of a fiery furnace; thrice did brave hector</p>
    <p class=l>and like a flame through fields of ripen’d corn,<br />the rage of hector o’er the ranks was borne.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seize him by the feet, striving with might and main to draw him</p>
    <p class=l>thrice the slain hero by the foot he drew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>away and calling loudly on the trojans, and thrice did the two</p>
    <p class=l>thrice to the skies the trojan clamours flew:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajaxes, clothed in valour as with a garment, beat him from off<br />the body; but all undaunted he would now charge into the thick of</p>
    <p class=l>as oft the ajaces his assault sustain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fight, and now again he would stand still and cry aloud, but</p>
    <p class=l>but check’d, he turns; repuls’d, attacks again.<br />with fiercer shouts his lingering troops he fires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he would give no ground.</p>
    <p class=l>nor yields a step, nor from his post retires:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as upland shepherds that cannot chase</p>
    <p class=l>so watchful shepherds strive to force, in vain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some famished lion from a carcase, even so could not the two<br />ajaxes scare hector son of priam from the body of patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>the hungry lion from a carcase slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now he would even have dragged it off and have won</p>
    <p class=l>even yet patroclus had he borne away,<br />and all the glories of the extended day,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>imperishable glory, had not iris fleet as the wind, winged her</p>
    <p class=l>had not high juno from the realms of air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>way as messenger from olympus to the son of peleus and bidden him</p>

    <p class=l>the various goddess of the showery bow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she came secretly without the knowledge of jove and of the</p>
    <p class=l>shot in a whirlwind to the shore below;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>other gods, for juno sent her, and when she had got close to him</p>
    <p class=l>to great achilles at his ships she came,<br />and thus began the many-colour’d dame:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she said, “up, son of peleus, mightiest of all mankind; rescue</p>
    <p class=l>“rise, son of peleus!<br />rise, divinely brave!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men are killing one another, the danaans in defence of the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dead body, while the trojans are trying to hale it away, and take</p>
    <p class=l>to drag him back to troy the foe contends:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it to windy ilius: hector is the most furious of them all; he is</p>
    <p class=l>nor with his death the rage of hector ends:<br />a prey to dogs he dooms the corse to lie,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for cutting the head from the body and fixing it on the stakes of</p>
    <p class=l>and marks the place to fix his head on high.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the wall.<br />up, then, and bide here no longer; shrink from the</p>
    <p class=l>rise, and prevent (if yet you think of fame)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thought that patroclus may become meat for the dogs of troy.<br />shame on you, should his body suffer any kind of outrage.</p>
    <p class=l>thy friend’s disgrace, thy own eternal shame!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and achilles said, “iris, which of the gods was it that sent you</p>
    <p class=l>“who sends thee, goddess, from the ethereal skies?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to me?</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>achilles thus.<br />and iris thus replies:<br />“i come, pelides!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>iris answered, “it was juno the royal spouse of jove, but the son</p>
    <p class=l>from the queen of jove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of saturn does not know of my coming, nor yet does any other of</p>
    <p class=l>the immortal empress of the realms above;<br />unknown to him who sits remote on high,</p>

    <p class=r>the immortals who dwell on the snowy summits of olympus.</p>
    <p class=l>unknown to all the synod of the sky.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then fleet achilles answered her saying, “how can i go up into</p>
    <p class=l>“thou comest in vain (he cries, with fury warm’d);</p>

    <p class=r>the battle?<br />they have my armour.</p>
    <p class=l>arms i have none, and can i fight unarm’d?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my mother forbade me to arm till</p>
    <p class=l>unwilling as i am, of force i stay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i should see her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armour</p>

    <p class=r>iris said, “we know that your armour has been taken, but go as</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you are; go to the deep trench and show yourself before the</p>

    <p class=r>trojans, that they may fear you and cease fighting.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fainting sons of the achaeans gain some brief breathing time,<br />which in battle may hardly be.</p>

    <p class=l>the hero rose:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>arose, and minerva flung her tasselled aegis round his strong</p>
    <p class=l>her ægis pallas o’er his shoulder throws;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shoulders; she crowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from</p>
    <p class=l>around his brows a golden cloud she spread;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which she kindled a glow of gleaming fire.</p>
    <p class=l>a stream of glory flamed above his head.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as the smoke that goes</p>
    <p class=l>as when from some beleaguer’d town arise<br />the smokes, high curling to the shaded skies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>up into heaven from some city that is being beleaguered on an</p>
    <p class=l>(seen from some island, o’er the main afar,</p>

    <p class=r>island far out at sea—all day long do men sally from the city and</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight their hardest, and at the going down of the sun the line of</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beacon-fires blazes forth, flaring high for those that dwell near</p>
    <p class=l>thick on the hills the flaming beacons blaze;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them to behold, if so be that they may come with their ships and</p>
    <p class=l>with long-projected beams the seas are bright,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>succour them—even so did the light flare from the head of</p>
    <p class=l>and heaven’s high arch reflects the ruddy light:<br />so from achilles’ head the splendours rise,<br />reflecting blaze on blaze against the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles, as he stood by the trench, going beyond the wall—but he<br />did not join the achaeans for he heeded the charge which his</p>
    <p class=l>forth march’d the chief, and distant from the crowd,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mother laid upon him.<br />there did he stand and shout aloud.</p>
    <p class=l>high on the rampart raised his voice aloud;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva also raised her voice</p>
    <p class=l>with her own shout minerva swells the sound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from afar, and spread terror unspeakable among the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>troy starts astonish’d, and the shores rebound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ringing as the note of a trumpet that sounds alarm then the foe</p>
    <p class=l>as the loud trumpet’s brazen mouth from far<br />with shrilling clangour sounds the alarm of war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is at the gates of a city, even so brazen was the voice of the</p>
    <p class=l>struck from the walls, the echoes float on high,<br />and the round bulwarks and thick towers reply;<br />so high his brazen voice the hero rear’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of aeacus, and when the trojans heard its clarion tones they</p>
    <p class=l>hosts dropp’d their arms, and trembled as they heard:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were dismayed; the horses turned back with their chariots for</p>
    <p class=l>and back the chariots roll, and coursers bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they boded mischief, and their drivers were awe-struck by the</p>
    <p class=l>and steeds and men lie mingled on the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>steady flame which the grey-eyed goddess had kindled above the</p>
    <p class=l>aghast they see the living lightnings play,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>head of the great son of peleus.</p>
    <p class=l>and turn their eyeballs from the flashing ray.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thrice did achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench,</p>
    <p class=l>thrice from the trench his dreadful voice he raised,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and thrice were the trojans and their brave allies thrown into</p>
    <p class=l>and thrice they fled, confounded and amazed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>confusion; whereon twelve of their noblest champions fell beneath</p>
    <p class=l>twelve in the tumult wedged, untimely rush’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the wheels of their chariots and perished by their own spears.</p>
    <p class=l>on their own spears, by their own chariots crush’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans to their great joy then drew patroclus out of reach</p>
    <p class=l>while, shielded from the darts, the greeks obtain<br />the long-contended carcase of the slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the weapons, and laid him on a litter: his comrades stood</p>
    <p class=l>a lofty bier the breathless warrior bears:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mourning round him, and among them fleet achilles who wept</p>
    <p class=l>around, his sad companions melt in tears.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bitterly as he saw his true comrade lying dead upon his bier.</p>
    <p class=l>but chief achilles, bending down his head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>pours unavailing sorrows o’er the dead,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had sent him out with horses and chariots into battle, but his</p>
    <p class=l>whom late triumphant, with his steeds and car,<br />he sent refulgent to the field of war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>return he was not to welcome.</p>
    <p class=l>(unhappy change!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then juno sent the busy sun, loth though he was, into the waters</p>
    <p class=l>) now senseless, pale, he found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of oceanus; so he set, and the achaeans had rest from the tug and</p>
    <p class=l>stretch’d forth, and gash’d with many a gaping wound.<br />meantime, unwearied with his heavenly way,<br />in ocean’s waves the unwilling light of day<br />quench’d his red orb, at juno’s high command,<br />and from their labours eased the achaian band.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>turmoil of war.<br />now the trojans when they had come out of the fight, unyoked</p>
    <p class=l>the frighted trojans (panting from the war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their horses and gathered in assembly before preparing their</p>
    <p class=l>their steeds unharness’d from the weary car)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>supper.</p>
    <p class=l>a sudden council call’d: each chief appear’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they kept their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for<br />fear had fallen upon them all because achilles had shown himself</p>
    <p class=l>in haste, and standing; for to sit they fear’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after having held aloof so long from battle.</p>
    <p class=l>’twas now no season for prolong’d debate;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>polydamas son of</p>
    <p class=l>they saw achilles, and in him their fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>panthous was first to speak, a man of judgement, who alone among</p>
    <p class=l>silent they stood: polydamas at last,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them could look both before and after.</p>
    <p class=l>skill’d to discern the future by the past,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was comrade to hector,</p>
    <p class=l>the son of panthus, thus express’d his fears<br />(the friend of hector, and of equal years;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and they had been born upon the same night; with all sincerity</p>
    <p class=l>the self-same night to both a being gave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:—</p>
    <p class=l>one wise in council, one in action brave):<br />[illustration: ] juno commanding the sun to set</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“look to it well, my friends; i would urge you to go back now to</p>
    <p class=l>“in free debate, my friends, your sentence speak;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your city and not wait here by the ships till morning, for we are</p>
    <p class=l>for me, i move, before the morning break,<br />to raise our camp: too dangerous here our post,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>far from our walls.</p>
    <p class=l>far from troy walls, and on a naked coast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so long as this man was at enmity with</p>
    <p class=l>i deem’d not greece so dreadful, while engaged</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon the achaeans were easier to deal with, and i would have</p>
    <p class=l>in mutual feuds her king and hero raged;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gladly camped by the ships in the hope of taking them; but now i</p>
    <p class=l>then, while we hoped our armies might prevail<br />we boldly camp’d beside a thousand sail.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>go in great fear of the fleet son of peleus; he is so daring that</p>
    <p class=l>i dread pelides now: his rage of mind</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he will never bide here on the plain whereon the trojans and</p>
    <p class=l>not long continues to the shores confined,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans fight with equal valour, but he will try to storm our</p>
    <p class=l>nor to the fields, where long in equal fray</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>city and carry off our women.</p>
    <p class=l>contending nations won and lost the day;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do then as i say, and let us</p>
    <p class=l>for troy, for troy, shall henceforth be the strife,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>retreat.</p>
    <p class=l>and the hard contest not for fame, but life.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for this is what will happen.</p>
    <p class=l>haste then to ilion, while the favouring night</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the darkness of night will</p>
    <p class=l>detains these terrors, keeps that arm from fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for a time stay the son of peleus, but if he find us here in the<br />morning when he sallies forth in full armour, we shall have</p>
    <p class=l>if but the morrow’s sun behold us here,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>knowledge of him in good earnest.</p>
    <p class=l>that arm, those terrors, we shall feel, not fear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glad indeed will he be who can</p>
    <p class=l>and hearts that now disdain, shall leap with joy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>escape and get back to ilius, and many a trojan will become meat</p>
    <p class=l>if heaven permit them then to enter troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for dogs and vultures may i never live to hear it.</p>
    <p class=l>let not my fatal prophecy be true,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if we do as i</p>
    <p class=l>nor what i tremble but to think, ensue.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>say, little though we may like it, we shall have strength in</p>
    <p class=l>whatever be our fate, yet let us try</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>counsel during the night, and the great gates with the doors that</p>
    <p class=l>what force of thought and reason can supply;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>close them will protect the city.</p>
    <p class=l>let us on counsel for our guard depend;<br />the town her gates and bulwarks shall defend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at dawn we can arm and take our</p>
    <p class=l>when morning dawns, our well-appointed powers,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stand on the walls; he will then rue it if he sallies from the<br />ships to fight us.</p>
    <p class=l>array’d in arms, shall line the lofty towers.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he will go back when he has given his horses</p>
    <p class=l>let the fierce hero, then, when fury calls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their fill of being driven all whithers under our walls, and will</p>
    <p class=l>vent his mad vengeance on our rocky walls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be in no mind to try and force his way into the city.</p>
    <p class=l>or fetch a thousand circles round the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neither</p>
    <p class=l>till his spent coursers seek the fleet again:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will he ever sack it, dogs shall devour him ere he do so.</p>
    <p class=l>so may his rage be tired, and labour’d down!<br />and dogs shall tear him ere he sack the town.</p>

    <p class=r>hector looked fiercely at him and answered, “polydamas, your</p>

    <p class=r>sold away to phrygia and fair meonia, for the hand of jove has<br />been laid heavily upon us.<br />now, therefore, that the son of</p>
    <p class=l>the phrygians now her scatter’d spoils enjoy,</p>

    <p class=r>scheming saturn has vouchsafed me to win glory here and to hem</p>

    <p class=r>thus spoke hector; and the trojans, fools that they were, shouted</p>
    <p class=l>the shouting host in loud applauses join’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in applause, for pallas minerva had robbed them of their</p>
    <p class=l>so pallas robb’d the many of their mind;</p>

    <p class=r>understanding.<br />they gave ear to hector with his evil counsel, but</p>
    <p class=l>to their own sense condemn’d, and left to choose</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the wise words of polydamas no man would heed.</p>
    <p class=l>the worst advice, the better to refuse.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they took their<br />supper throughout the host, and meanwhile through the whole night</p>
    <p class=l>while the long night extends her sable reign,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans mourned patroclus, and the son of peleus led them in</p>
    <p class=l>around patroclus mourn’d the grecian train.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their lament.</p>
    <p class=l>stern in superior grief pelides stood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he laid his murderous hands upon the breast of his</p>
    <p class=l>those slaughtering arms, so used to bathe in blood,<br />now clasp his clay-cold limbs: then gushing start<br />the tears, and sighs burst from his swelling heart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>comrade, groaning again and again as a bearded lion when a man</p>
    <p class=l>the lion thus, with dreadful anguish stung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who was chasing deer has robbed him of his young in some dense</p>
    <p class=l>roars through the desert, and demands his young;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forest; when the lion comes back he is furious, and searches</p>
    <p class=l>when the grim savage, to his rifled den<br />too late returning, snuffs the track of men,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dingle and dell to track the hunter if he can find him, for he is</p>
    <p class=l>and o’er the vales and o’er the forest bounds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mad with rage—even so with many a sigh did achilles speak among</p>
    <p class=l>his clamorous grief the bellowing wood resounds.<br />so grieves achilles; and, impetuous, vents<br />to all his myrmidons his loud laments.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the myrmidons saying, “alas!</p>
    <p class=l>“in what vain promise, gods!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vain were the words with which i</p>
    <p class=l>did i engage,</p>

    <p class=r>bring his brave son back again to opoeis after he had sacked</p>
    <p class=l>i vowed his much-loved offspring to restore,</p>

    <p class=r>nevertheless, o</p>
    <p class=l>yet a space i stay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus, now that i am left behind you, i will not bury you,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whom we have taken with spear and strength of arm when we sacked</p>

    <p class=r>then achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the fire</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that they might wash the clotted gore from off patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>cleanse the pale corse, and wash each honour’d wound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon</p>
    <p class=l>a massy caldron of stupendous frame</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they set a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire: they</p>
    <p class=l>they brought, and placed it o’er the rising flame:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>threw sticks on to it to make it blaze, and the water became hot</p>
    <p class=l>then heap’d the lighted wood; the flame divides<br />beneath the vase, and climbs around the sides:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as the flame played about the belly of the tripod.</p>
    <p class=l>in its wide womb they pour the rushing stream;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the water</p>
    <p class=l>the boiling water bubbles to the brim.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the cauldron was boiling they washed the body, anointed it</p>
    <p class=l>the body then they bathe with pious toil,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with oil, and closed its wounds with ointment that had been kept</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then they laid it on a bier and covered it with a<br />linen cloth from head to foot, and over this they laid a fair</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles to mourn patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>that done, their sorrows and their sighs renew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then jove said to juno his sister-wife, “so, queen juno, you have</p>

    <p class=r>they were finished all but</p>

    <p class=r>hand in her own, saying, “why have you come to our house, thetis,</p>
    <p class=l>and, smiling, thus the watery queen address’d:<br />“what, goddess!</p>

    <p class=r>nine years did i stay with them, and</p>
    <p class=l>even then these arts employ’d my infant thought:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many beautiful works in bronze, brooches, spiral armlets, cups,<br />and chains, did i make for them in their cave, with the roaring</p>

    <p class=r>knew, neither of gods nor men, save only thetis and eurynome who</p>

    <p class=r>them towards the fire and bidding them do their office.</p>
    <p class=l>to the black labours of his forge retires.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>twenty</p>
    <p class=l>soon as he bade them blow, the bellows turn’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bellows blew upon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every</p>
    <p class=l>their iron mouths; and where the furnace burn’d,<br />resounding breathed: at once the blast expires,<br />and twenty forges catch at once the fires;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>kind, some fierce to help him when he had need of them, and</p>
    <p class=l>just as the god directs, now loud, now low,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>others less strong as vulcan willed it in the course of his work.</p>
    <p class=l>they raise a tempest, or they gently blow;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he threw tough copper into the fire, and tin, with silver and</p>
    <p class=l>in hissing flames huge silver bars are roll’d,<br />and stubborn brass, and tin, and solid gold;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gold; he set his great anvil on its block, and with one hand</p>
    <p class=l>before, deep fix’d, the eternal anvils stand;<br />the ponderous hammer loads his better hand,<br />his left with tongs turns the vex’d metal round,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grasped his mighty hammer while he took the tongs in the other.</p>
    <p class=l>and thick, strong strokes, the doubling vaults rebound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all</p>
    <p class=l>then first he form’d the immense and solid shield;<br />rich various artifice emblazed the field;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over and binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three</p>
    <p class=l>its utmost verge a threefold circle bound;[253]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>layers; and the baldric was made of silver.</p>
    <p class=l>a silver chain suspends the massy round;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he made the shield in</p>
    <p class=l>five ample plates the broad expanse compose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>five thicknesses, and with many a wonder did his cunning hand</p>
    <p class=l>and godlike labours on the surface rose.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>enrich it.</p>
    <p class=l>there shone the image of the master-mind:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at</p>
    <p class=l>there earth, there heaven, there ocean he design’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her full and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify</p>
    <p class=l>the unwearied sun, the moon completely round;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the face of heaven—the pleiads, the hyads, huge orion, and the</p>
    <p class=l>the starry lights that heaven’s high convex crown’d;<br />the pleiads, hyads, with the northern team;<br />and great orion’s more refulgent beam;<br />to which, around the axle of the sky,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bear, which men also call the wain and which turns round ever in</p>
    <p class=l>the bear, revolving, points his golden eye,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one place, facing orion, and alone never dips into the stream of</p>
    <p class=l>still shines exalted on the ethereal plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>oceanus.</p>
    <p class=l>nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he wrought also two cities, fair to see and busy with the hum of</p>
    <p class=l>two cities radiant on the shield appear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men.</p>
    <p class=l>the image one of peace, and one of war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the one were weddings and wedding-feasts, and they were</p>
    <p class=l>here sacred pomp and genial feast delight,<br />and solemn dance, and hymeneal rite;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>going about the city with brides whom they were escorting by</p>
    <p class=l>along the street the new-made brides are led,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>torchlight from their chambers.<br />loud rose the cry of hymen, and</p>
    <p class=l>with torches flaming, to the nuptial bed:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the youths danced to the music of flute and lyre, while the women</p>
    <p class=l>the youthful dancers in a circle bound<br />to the soft flute, and cithern’s silver sound:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stood each at her house door to see them.</p>
    <p class=l>through the fair streets the matrons in a row<br />stand in their porches, and enjoy the show.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, for there was a</p>
    <p class=l>there in the forum swarm a numerous train;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quarrel, and two men were wrangling about the blood-money for a</p>
    <p class=l>the subject of debate, a townsman slain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>man who had been killed, the one saying before the people that he<br />had paid damages in full, and the other that he had not been</p>
    <p class=l>one pleads the fine discharged, which one denied,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>paid.</p>
    <p class=l>and bade the public and the laws decide:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>each was trying to make his own case good, and the people</p>
    <p class=l>the witness is produced on either hand:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>took sides, each man backing the side that he had taken; but the</p>
    <p class=l>for this, or that, the partial people stand:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heralds kept them back, and the elders sate on their seats of</p>
    <p class=l>the appointed heralds still the noisy bands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stone in a solemn circle, holding the staves which the heralds</p>
    <p class=l>and form a ring, with sceptres in their hands:<br />on seats of stone, within the sacred place,[254]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had put into their hands.</p>
    <p class=l>the reverend elders nodded o’er the case;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then they rose and each in his turn</p>
    <p class=l>alternate, each the attesting sceptre took,<br />and rising solemn, each his sentence spoke.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gave judgement, and there were two talents laid down, to be given</p>
    <p class=l>two golden talents lay amidst, in sight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to him whose judgement should be deemed the fairest.</p>
    <p class=l>the prize of him who best adjudged the right.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about the other city there lay encamped two hosts in gleaming</p>
    <p class=l>another part (a prospect differing far)[255]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>armour, and they were divided whether to sack it, or to spare it</p>
    <p class=l>glow’d with refulgent arms, and horrid war.<br />two mighty hosts a leaguer’d town embrace,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and accept the half of what it contained.</p>
    <p class=l>and one would pillage, one would burn the place.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but the men of the city</p>
    <p class=l>meantime the townsmen, arm’d with silent care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would not yet consent, and armed themselves for a surprise; their</p>
    <p class=l>a secret ambush on the foe prepare:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wives and little children kept guard upon the walls, and with</p>
    <p class=l>their wives, their children, and the watchful band</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them were the men who were past fighting through age; but the</p>
    <p class=l>of trembling parents, on the turrets stand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>others sallied forth with mars and pallas minerva at their</p>
    <p class=l>they march; by pallas and by mars made bold:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>head—both of them wrought in gold and clad in golden raiment,</p>
    <p class=l>gold were the gods, their radiant garments gold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great and fair with their armour as befitting gods, while they</p>
    <p class=l>and gold their armour: these the squadron led,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that followed were smaller.</p>
    <p class=l>august, divine, superior by the head!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they reached the place where<br />they would lay their ambush, it was on a riverbed to which live<br />stock of all kinds would come from far and near to water; here,</p>
    <p class=l>a place for ambush fit they found, and stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then, they lay concealed, clad in full armour.</p>
    <p class=l>cover’d with shields, beside a silver flood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some way off them<br />there were two scouts who were on the look-out for the coming of</p>
    <p class=l>two spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sheep or cattle, which presently came, followed by two shepherds</p>
    <p class=l>if sheep or oxen seek the winding stream.<br />soon the white flocks proceeded o’er the plains,<br />and steers slow-moving, and two shepherd swains;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who were playing on their pipes, and had not so much as a thought</p>
    <p class=l>behind them piping on their reeds they go,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of danger.</p>
    <p class=l>nor fear an ambush, nor suspect a foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when those who were in ambush saw this, they cut off</p>
    <p class=l>in arms the glittering squadron rising round</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the flocks and herds and killed the shepherds.</p>
    <p class=l>rush sudden; hills of slaughter heap the ground;<br />whole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains,<br />and, all amidst them, dead, the shepherd swains!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the<br />besiegers, when they heard much noise among the cattle as they</p>
    <p class=l>the bellowing oxen the besiegers hear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sat in council, sprang to their horses, and made with all speed<br />towards them; when they reached them they set battle in array by</p>
    <p class=l>they rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the banks of the river, and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod</p>
    <p class=l>they fight, they fall, beside the silver flood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spears at one another.</p>
    <p class=l>the waving silver seem’d to blush with blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with them were strife and riot, and fell</p>
    <p class=l>there tumult, there contention stood confess’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fate who was dragging three men after her, one with a fresh</p>
    <p class=l>one rear’d a dagger at a captive’s breast;<br />one held a living foe, that freshly bled</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wound, and the other unwounded, while the third was dead, and she</p>
    <p class=l>with new-made wounds; another dragg’d a dead;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was dragging him along by his heel: and her robe was bedrabbled</p>
    <p class=l>now here, now there, the carcases they tore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in men’s blood.</p>
    <p class=l>fate stalk’d amidst them, grim with human gore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they went in and out with one another and fought</p>
    <p class=l>and the whole war came out, and met the eye;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as though they were living people haling away one another’s dead.</p>
    <p class=l>and each bold figure seem’d to live or die.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughed</p>
    <p class=l>a field deep furrow’d next the god design’d,[256]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>already.</p>
    <p class=l>the third time labour’d by the sweating hind;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many men were working at the plough within it, turning</p>
    <p class=l>the shining shares full many ploughmen guide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their oxen to and fro, furrow after furrow.</p>
    <p class=l>and turn their crooked yokes on every side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>each time that they</p>
    <p class=l>still as at either end they wheel around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>turned on reaching the headland a man would come up to them and</p>
    <p class=l>the master meets them with his goblet crown’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>give them a cup of wine, and they would go back to their furrows<br />looking forward to the time when they should again reach the</p>
    <p class=l>the hearty draught rewards, renews their toil,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>headland.</p>
    <p class=l>then back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the part that they had ploughed was dark behind them,</p>
    <p class=l>behind, the rising earth in ridges roll’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so that the field, though it was of gold, still looked as if it</p>
    <p class=l>and sable look’d, though form’d of molten gold.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were being ploughed—very curious to behold.<br />he wrought also a field of harvest corn, and the reapers were</p>
    <p class=l>another field rose high with waving grain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>reaping with sharp sickles in their hands.</p>
    <p class=l>with bended sickles stand the reaper train:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>swathe after swathe</p>
    <p class=l>here stretched in ranks the levell’d swarths are found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fell to the ground in a straight line behind them, and the</p>
    <p class=l>sheaves heap’d on sheaves here thicken up the ground.<br />with sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>binders bound them in bands of twisted straw.</p>
    <p class=l>the gatherers follow, and collect in bands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there were three<br />binders, and behind them there were boys who gathered the cut</p>
    <p class=l>and last the children, in whose arms are borne</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>corn in armfuls and kept on bringing them to be bound: among them</p>
    <p class=l>(too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all the owner of the land stood by in silence and was glad.</p>
    <p class=l>the rustic monarch of the field descries,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>with silent glee, the heaps around him rise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>servants were getting a meal ready under an oak, for they had</p>
    <p class=l>a ready banquet on the turf is laid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sacrificed a great ox, and were busy cutting him up, while the</p>
    <p class=l>beneath an ample oak’s expanded shade.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>women were making a porridge of much white barley for the</p>
    <p class=l>the victim ox the sturdy youth prepare;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>labourers’ dinner.</p>
    <p class=l>the reaper’s due repast, the woman’s care.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vines</p>
    <p class=l>next, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were loaded with grapes.</p>
    <p class=l>bent with the ponderous harvest of its vines;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the bunches overhead were black, but the</p>
    <p class=l>a deeper dye the dangling clusters show,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vines were trained on poles of silver.</p>
    <p class=l>and curl’d on silver props, in order glow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he ran a ditch of dark</p>
    <p class=l>a darker metal mix’d intrench’d the place;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>metal all round it, and fenced it with a fence of tin; there was</p>
    <p class=l>and pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>only one path to it, and by this the vintagers went when they</p>
    <p class=l>to this, one pathway gently winding leads,<br />where march a train with baskets on their heads,<br />(fair maids and blooming youths,) that smiling bear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would gather the vintage.</p>
    <p class=l>the purple product of the autumnal year.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>youths and maidens all blithe and full</p>
    <p class=l>to these a youth awakes the warbling strings,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of glee, carried the luscious fruit in plaited baskets; and with</p>
    <p class=l>whose tender lay the fate of linus sings;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them there went a boy who made sweet music with his lyre, and</p>
    <p class=l>in measured dance behind him move the train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sang the linos-song with his clear boyish voice.</p>
    <p class=l>tune soft the voice, and answer to the strain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he wrought also a herd of horned cattle.</p>
    <p class=l>here herds of oxen march, erect and bold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he made the cows of gold</p>
    <p class=l>rear high their horns, and seem to low in gold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and tin, and they lowed as they came full speed out of the yards<br />to go and feed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of</p>
    <p class=l>and speed to meadows on whose sounding shores</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the river.</p>
    <p class=l>a rapid torrent through the rushes roars:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>along with the cattle there went four shepherds, all</p>
    <p class=l>four golden herdsmen as their guardians stand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of them in gold, and their nine fleet dogs went with them.</p>
    <p class=l>and nine sour dogs complete the rustic band.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two<br />terrible lions had fastened on a bellowing bull that was with the</p>
    <p class=l>two lions rushing from the wood appear’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foremost cows, and bellow as he might they haled him, while the</p>
    <p class=l>and seized a bull, the master of the herd:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dogs and men gave chase: the lions tore through the bull’s thick</p>
    <p class=l>he roar’d: in vain the dogs, the men withstood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hide and were gorging on his blood and bowels, but the herdsmen</p>
    <p class=l>they tore his flesh, and drank his sable blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were afraid to do anything, and only hounded on their dogs; the<br />dogs dared not fasten on the lions but stood by barking and</p>
    <p class=l>the dogs (oft cheer’d in vain) desert the prey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>keeping out of harm’s way.</p>
    <p class=l>dread the grim terrors, and at distance bay.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the god wrought also a pasture in a fair mountain dell, and a</p>
    <p class=l>next this, the eye the art of vulcan leads</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>large flock of sheep, with a homestead and huts, and sheltered</p>
    <p class=l>deep through fair forests, and a length of meads,<br />and stalls, and folds, and scatter’d cots between;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sheepfolds.</p>
    <p class=l>and fleecy flocks, that whiten all the scene.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>furthermore he wrought a green, like that which daedalus once</p>
    <p class=l>a figured dance succeeds; such once was seen</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>made in cnossus for lovely ariadne.</p>
    <p class=l>in lofty gnossus for the cretan queen,<br />form’d by daedalean art; a comely band</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hereon there danced youths<br />and maidens whom all would woo, with their hands on one another’s<br />wrists.<br />the maidens wore robes of light linen, and the youths</p>
    <p class=l>of youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>well woven shirts that were slightly oiled.</p>
    <p class=l>the maids in soft simars of linen dress’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the girls were</p>
    <p class=l>the youths all graceful in the glossy vest:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>crowned with garlands, while the young men had daggers of gold</p>
    <p class=l>of those the locks with flowery wreath inroll’d;<br />of these the sides adorn’d with swords of gold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that hung by silver baldrics; sometimes they would dance deftly</p>
    <p class=l>that glittering gay, from silver belts depend.<br />now all at once they rise, at once descend,<br />with well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways,<br />confusedly regular, the moving maze:<br />now forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in a ring with merry twinkling feet, as it were a potter sitting</p>
    <p class=l>and undistinguish’d blend the flying ring:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at his work and making trial of his wheel to see whether it will</p>
    <p class=l>so whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>run, and sometimes they would go all in line with one another,</p>
    <p class=l>and, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and much people was gathered joyously about the green.</p>
    <p class=l>the gazing multitudes admire around:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there was<br />a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two tumblers</p>
    <p class=l>two active tumblers in the centre bound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went about performing in the midst of them when the man struck up</p>
    <p class=l>now high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with his tune.</p>
    <p class=l>and general songs the sprightly revel end.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stream of the river oceanus.</p>
    <p class=l>with his last hand, and pour’d the ocean round:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then when he had fashioned the shield so great and strong, he</p>
    <p class=l>in living silver seem’d the waves to roll,<br />and beat the buckler’s verge, and bound the whole.<br />this done, whate’er a warrior’s use requires</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>made a breastplate also that shone brighter than fire.<br />he made a</p>
    <p class=l>he forged; the cuirass that outshone the fires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>helmet, close fitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a</p>
    <p class=l>the greaves of ductile tin, the helm impress’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>golden plume overhanging it; and he made greaves also of beaten<br />tin.</p>
    <p class=l>with various sculpture, and the golden crest.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armour, he took</p>
    <p class=l>at thetis’ feet the finished labour lay:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it and set it before the mother of achilles; whereon she darted</p>
    <p class=l>she, as a falcon cuts the aerial way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like a falcon from the snowy summits of olympus and bore away the</p>
    <p class=l>swift from olympus’ snowy summit flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gleaming armour from the house of vulcan.</p>

    <p class=l>the reconciliation of achilles and agamemnon.<br />thetis brings to her son the armour made by vulcan.<br />she preserves the<br />body of his friend from corruption, and commands him to assemble the<br />army, to declare his resentment at an end.<br />agamemnon and achilles are<br />solemnly reconciled: the speeches, presents, and ceremonies on that<br />occasion.<br />achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from<br />the battle till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of<br />ulysses.<br />the presents are conveyed to the tent of achilles, where<br />briseïs laments over the body of patroclus.<br />the hero obstinately</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vulcan had made him, and goes out to fight.</p>
    <p class=l>refuses all repast, and gives himself up to lamentations for his<br />friend.<br />minerva descends to strengthen him, by the order of jupiter.<br />he<br />arms for the fight: his appearance described.<br />he addresses himself to<br />his horses, and reproaches them with the death of patroclus.<br />one of<br />them is miraculously endued with voice, and inspired to prophesy his<br />fate: but the hero, not astonished by that prodigy, rushes with fury to<br />the combat.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now when dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of</p>
    <p class=l>the thirtieth day.<br />the scene is on the sea-shore.<br />soon as aurora heaved her orient head<br />above the waves, that blush’d with early red,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>oceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, thetis reached</p>
    <p class=l>(with new-born day to gladden mortal sight,<br />and gild the courts of heaven with sacred light,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ships with the armour that the god had given her.</p>
    <p class=l>the immortal arms the goddess-mother bears</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she found<br />her son fallen about the body of patroclus and weeping bitterly.</p>
    <p class=l>swift to her son: her son she finds in tears</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many also of his followers were weeping round him, but when the</p>
    <p class=l>stretch’d o’er patroclus’ corse; while all the rest</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>goddess came among them she clasped his hand in her own, saying,</p>
    <p class=l>their sovereign’s sorrows in their own express’d.<br />a ray divine her heavenly presence shed,<br />and thus, his hand soft touching, thetis said:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my son, grieve as we may we must let this man lie, for it is by</p>
    <p class=l>“suppress, my son, this rage of grief, and know</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heaven’s will that he has fallen; now, therefore, accept from</p>
    <p class=l>it was not man, but heaven, that gave the blow;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vulcan this rich and goodly armour, which no man has ever yet</p>
    <p class=l>behold what arms by vulcan are bestow’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>borne upon his shoulders.</p>
    <p class=l>arms worthy thee, or fit to grace a god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as she spoke she set the armour before achilles, and it rang out</p>
    <p class=l>then drops the radiant burden on the ground;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bravely as she did so.</p>
    <p class=l>clang the strong arms, and ring the shores around;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the myrmidons were struck with awe, and<br />none dared look full at it, for they were afraid; but achilles</p>
    <p class=l>back shrink the myrmidons with dread surprise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was roused to still greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a</p>
    <p class=l>and from the broad effulgence turn their eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fierce light, for he was glad when he handled the splendid</p>
    <p class=l>unmoved the hero kindles at the show,<br />and feels with rage divine his bosom glow;<br />from his fierce eyeballs living flames expire,<br />and flash incessant like a stream of fire:<br />he turns the radiant gift: and feeds his mind</p>

    <p class=r>present which the god had made him.</p>
    <p class=l>on all the immortal artist had design’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then, as soon as he had</p>
    <p class=l>“goddess!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>satisfied himself with looking at it, he said to his mother,</p>
    <p class=l>(he cried,) these glorious arms, that shine</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“mother, the god has given me armour, meet handiwork for an</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>immortal and such as no-one living could have fashioned; i will</p>
    <p class=l>now to the bloody battle let me bend:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now arm, but i much fear that flies will settle upon the son of</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that his body, now</p>
    <p class=l>in those wide wounds through which his spirit fled,</p>

    <p class=r>he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.</p>
    <p class=l>shall flies, and worms obscene, pollute the dead?</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>silver-footed thetis answered, “my son, be not disquieted about<br />this matter.<br />i will find means to protect him from the swarms of<br />noisome flies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed</p>
    <p class=l>“that unavailing care be laid aside,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in battle.</p>
    <p class=l>(the azure goddess to her son replied,)</p>

    <p class=r>he may lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still</p>
    <p class=l>whole years untouch’d, uninjured shall remain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be as sound as ever, or even sounder.</p>
    <p class=l>fresh as in life, the carcase of the slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>call, therefore, the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaean heroes in assembly; unsay your anger against agamemnon;</p>
    <p class=l>before the grecian peers renounce thine ire:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>arm at once, and fight with might and main.</p>
    <p class=l>then uncontroll’d in boundless war engage,<br />and heaven with strength supply the mighty rage!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she</p>

    <p class=r>then dropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then achilles went out upon the sea-shore, and with a loud cry</p>
    <p class=l>achilles to the strand obedient went:<br />the shores resounded with the voice he sent.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>called on the achaean heroes.</p>
    <p class=l>the heroes heard, and all the naval train</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this even those who as yet had<br />stayed always at the ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the</p>
    <p class=l>that tend the ships, or guide them o’er the main,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stewards who were about the ships and served out rations, all</p>
    <p class=l>alarm’d, transported, at the well-known sound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came to the place of assembly because achilles had shown himself</p>
    <p class=l>frequent and full, the great assembly crown’d;<br />studious to see the terror of the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after having held aloof so long from fighting.</p>
    <p class=l>long lost to battle, shine in arms again.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two sons of mars,</p>
    <p class=l>tydides and ulysses first appear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses and the son of tydeus, came limping, for their wounds<br />still pained them; nevertheless they came, and took their seats</p>
    <p class=l>lame with their wounds, and leaning on the spear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the front row of the assembly.</p>
    <p class=l>these on the sacred seats of council placed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>last of all came agamemnon,</p>
    <p class=l>the king of men, atrides, came the last:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>king of men, he too wounded, for coon son of antenor had struck</p>
    <p class=l>he too sore wounded by agenor’s son.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him with a spear in battle.</p>
    <p class=l>achilles (rising in the midst) begun:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the achaeans were got together achilles rose and said, “son</p>
    <p class=l>“o monarch!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of atreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you</p>
    <p class=l>better far had been the fate<br />of thee, of me, of all the grecian state,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and me, when we two were in such high anger about briseis, surely</p>
    <p class=l>if (ere the day when by mad passion sway’d,<br />rash we contended for the black-eyed maid)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it would have been better, had diana’s arrow slain her at the</p>
    <p class=l>preventing dian had despatch’d her dart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships on the day when i took her after having sacked lyrnessus.</p>
    <p class=l>and shot the shining mischief to the heart!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for so, many an achaean the less would have bitten dust before</p>
    <p class=l>then many a hero had not press’d the shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the foe in the days of my anger.<br />it has been well for hector and</p>
    <p class=l>nor troy’s glad fields been fatten’d with our gore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans, but the achaeans will long indeed remember our</p>
    <p class=l>long, long shall greece the woes we caused bewail,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quarrel.</p>
    <p class=l>and sad posterity repeat the tale.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, however, let it be, for it is over.</p>
    <p class=l>but this, no more the subject of debate,<br />is past, forgotten, and resign’d to fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if we have been</p>
    <p class=l>why should, alas, a mortal man, as i,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>angry, necessity has schooled our anger.</p>
    <p class=l>burn with a fury that can never die?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i put it from me: i dare</p>
    <p class=l>here then my anger ends: let war succeed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not nurse it for ever; therefore, bid the achaeans arm forthwith</p>
    <p class=l>and even as greece has bled, let ilion bleed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that i may go out against the trojans, and learn whether they</p>
    <p class=l>now call the hosts, and try if in our sight</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will be in a mind to sleep by the ships or no.</p>
    <p class=l>troy yet shall dare to camp a second night!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glad, i ween, will</p>
    <p class=l>i deem, their mightiest, when this arm he knows,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he be to rest his knees who may fly my spear when i wield it.</p>
    <p class=l>shall ’scape with transport, and with joy repose.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he speak, and the achaeans rejoiced in that he had put</p>
    <p class=l>he said: his finish’d wrath with loud acclaim</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>away his anger.</p>
    <p class=l>the greeks accept, and shout pelides’ name.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the</p>
    <p class=l>when thus, not rising from his lofty throne,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>middle of the assembly.</p>
    <p class=l>in state unmoved, the king of men begun:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“danaan heroes,” said he, “servants of</p>
    <p class=l>“hear me, ye sons of greece!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mars, it is well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it<br />is not seemly to interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a<br />practised speaker.<br />who can either hear or speak in an uproar?</p>
    <p class=l>with silence hear!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even the finest orator will be disconcerted by it.</p>
    <p class=l>and grant your monarch an impartial ear:<br />awhile your loud, untimely joy suspend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will expound</p>
    <p class=l>and let your rash, injurious clamours end:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to the son of peleus, and do you other achaeans heed me and mark</p>
    <p class=l>unruly murmurs, or ill-timed applause,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me well.</p>
    <p class=l>wrong the best speaker, and the justest cause.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>often have the achaeans spoken to me of this matter and</p>
    <p class=l>nor charge on me, ye greeks, the dire debate:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upbraided me, but it was not i that did it: jove, and fate, and</p>
    <p class=l>know, angry jove, and all-compelling fate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>erinys that walks in darkness struck me mad when we were<br />assembled on the day that i took from achilles the meed that had</p>
    <p class=l>with fell erinnys, urged my wrath that day</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>been awarded to him.</p>
    <p class=l>when from achilles’ arms i forced the prey.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what could i do?</p>
    <p class=l>what then could i against the will of heaven?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all things are in the hand</p>
    <p class=l>not by myself, but vengeful ate driven;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of heaven, and folly, eldest of jove’s daughters, shuts men’s</p>
    <p class=l>she, jove’s dread daughter, fated to infest</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eyes to their destruction.</p>
    <p class=l>the race of mortals, enter’d in my breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she walks delicately, not on the solid</p>
    <p class=l>not on the ground that haughty fury treads,<br />but prints her lofty footsteps on the heads</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>earth, but hovers over the heads of men to make them stumble or</p>
    <p class=l>of mighty men; inflicting as she goes</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to ensnare them.</p>
    <p class=l>long-festering wounds, inextricable woes!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“time was when she fooled jove himself, who they say is greatest</p>
    <p class=l>of old, she stalk’d amid the bright abodes;</p>

    <p class=r>whether of gods or men; for juno, woman though she was, beguiled</p>
    <p class=l>and jove himself, the sire of men and gods,<br />the world’s great ruler, felt her venom’d dart;<br />deceived by juno’s wiles, and female art:</p>

    <p class=l>and jove expected his immortal son,</p>

    <p class=l>’</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said juno all crafty and full of guile, ‘you will play false, and<br />will not hold to your word.<br />swear me, o olympian, swear me a<br />great oath, that he who shall this day fall between the feet of a<br />woman, shall be lord over all that dwell about him who are of</p>

    <p class=l>and fix dominion on the favour’d youth.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“thus she spoke, and jove suspected her not, but swore the great</p>
    <p class=l>the thunderer, unsuspicious of the fraud,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>oath, to his much ruing thereafter.</p>
    <p class=l>pronounced those solemn words that bind a god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for juno darted down from the<br />high summit of olympus, and went in haste to achaean argos where</p>
    <p class=l>the joyful goddess, from olympus’ height,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she knew that the noble wife of sthenelus son of perseus then</p>
    <p class=l>swift to achaian argos bent her flight:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was.<br />she being with child and in her seventh month, juno brought</p>

    <p class=r>the child to birth though there was a month still wanting, but</p>
    <p class=l>she push’d her lingering infant into life:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she stayed the offspring of alcmena, and kept back the ilithuiae.</p>
    <p class=l>her charms alcmena’s coming labours stay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then she went to tell jove the son of saturn, and said, ‘father</p>

    <p class=r>caught folly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never</p>

    <p class=r>the bane of all.<br />then he whirled her round with a twist of his<br />hand, and flung her down from heaven so that she fell on to the</p>
    <p class=l>thence on the nether world the fury fell;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fields of mortal men; and he was ever angry with her when he saw</p>

    <p class=r>his son groaning under the cruel labours that eurystheus laid</p>

    <p class=r>upon him.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so did i grieve when mighty hector was killing the</p>
    <p class=l>even thus, like jove himself, was i misled,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>argives at their ships, and all the time i kept thinking of folly</p>
    <p class=l>while raging hector heap’d our camps with dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who had so baned me.</p>
    <p class=l>what can the errors of my rage atone?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i was blind, and jove robbed me of my<br />reason; i will now make atonement, and will add much treasure by</p>

    <p class=r>way of amends.</p>
    <p class=l>this instant from the navy shall be sent</p>

    <p class=l>but thou!</p>

    <p class=r>i will give you all that ulysses offered you yesterday<br />in your tents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fain fight at once, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my<br />ship, that you may see whether what i give you is enough.</p>
    <p class=l>resume thy arms, and shine again in war.</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and achilles answered, “son of atreus, king of men agamemnon, you</p>
    <p class=l>“o king of nations!<br />whose superior sway<br />(returns achilles) all our hosts obey!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can give such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold</p>
    <p class=l>to keep or send the presents, be thy care;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them: it is in your own hands.<br />let us now set battle in array; it</p>
    <p class=l>to us, ’tis equal: all we ask is war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is not well to tarry talking about trifles, for there is a deed</p>
    <p class=l>while yet we talk, or but an instant shun</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which is as yet to do.</p>
    <p class=l>the fight, our glorious work remains undone.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles shall again be seen fighting</p>
    <p class=l>let every greek, who sees my spear confound</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among the foremost, and laying low the ranks of the trojans: bear</p>
    <p class=l>the trojan ranks, and deal destruction round,<br />with emulation, what i act survey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this in mind each one of you when he is fighting.</p>

    <p class=r>the sun if he is without food; however much he may want to fight</p>
    <p class=l>courage may prompt; but, ebbing out his strength,<br />mere unsupported man must yield at length;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his strength will fail him before he knows it; hunger and thirst</p>
    <p class=l>shrunk with dry famine, and with toils declined,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will find him out, and his limbs will grow weary under him.</p>
    <p class=l>the drooping body will desert the mind:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but a</p>
    <p class=l>but built anew with strength-conferring fare,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>man can fight all day if he is full fed with meat and wine; his<br />heart beats high, and his strength will stay till he has routed</p>
    <p class=l>with limbs and soul untamed, he tires a war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all his foes; therefore, send the people away and bid them</p>
    <p class=l>dismiss the people, then, and give command,<br />with strong repast to hearten every band;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>prepare their meal; king agamemnon will bring out the gifts in</p>

    <p class=r>presence of the assembly, that all may see them and you may be</p>
    <p class=l>in full assembly of all greece be laid.<br />the king of men shall rise in public sight,</p>

    <p class=r>satisfied.<br />moreover let him swear an oath before the argives that</p>

    <p class=r>he has never gone up into the couch of briseis, nor been with her<br />after the manner of men and women; and do you, too, show yourself</p>
    <p class=l>that, spotless, as she came, the maid removes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of a gracious mind; let agamemnon entertain you in his tents with</p>
    <p class=l>pure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a feast of reconciliation, that so you may have had your dues in</p>

    <p class=r>full.</p>
    <p class=l>and the full price of injured honour paid.</p>

    <p class=r>as for you, son of atreus, treat people more righteously in</p>

    <p class=r>amends if he was wrong in the first instance.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and king agamemnon answered, “son of laertes, your words please</p>

    <p class=l>thy words give joy, and wisdom breathes in thee.<br />each due atonement gladly i prepare;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will swear as<br />you would have me do; i do so of my own free will, neither shall<br />i take the name of heaven in vain.</p>
    <p class=l>and heaven regard me as i justly swear!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let, then, achilles wait,</p>
    <p class=l>here then awhile let greece assembled stay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>though he would fain fight at once, and do you others wait also,</p>
    <p class=l>nor great achilles grudge this short delay.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>till the gifts come from my tent and we ratify the oath with</p>

    <p class=l>and jove attesting, the firm compact made.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus, then, do i charge you: take some noble young</p>
    <p class=l>a train of noble youths the charge shall bear;<br />these to select, ulysses, be thy care:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans with you, and bring from my tents the gifts that i</p>
    <p class=l>in order rank’d let all our gifts appear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>promised yesterday to achilles, and bring the women also;</p>
    <p class=l>and the fair train of captives close the rear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>furthermore let talthybius find me a boar from those that are</p>
    <p class=l>talthybius shall the victim boar convey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with the host, and make it ready for sacrifice to jove and to the</p>
    <p class=l>sacred to jove, and yon bright orb of day.</p>

    <p class=r>then said achilles, “son of atreus, king of men agamemnon, see to</p>
    <p class=l>“for this (the stern æacides replies)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these matters at some other season, when there is breathing time</p>
    <p class=l>some less important season may suffice,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and when i am calmer.</p>
    <p class=l>when the stern fury of the war is o’er,<br />and wrath, extinguish’d, burns my breast no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would you have men eat while the bodies of</p>
    <p class=l>by hector slain, their faces to the sky,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>those whom hector son of priam slew are still lying mangled upon</p>
    <p class=l>all grim with gaping wounds, our heroes lie:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the plain?</p>
    <p class=l>those call to war!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let the sons of the achaeans, say i, fight fasting and</p>
    <p class=l>and might my voice incite,<br />now, now, this instant, shall commence the fight:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>without food, till we have avenged them; afterwards at the going</p>
    <p class=l>then, when the day’s complete, let generous bowls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>down of the sun let them eat their fill.</p>
    <p class=l>and copious banquets, glad your weary souls.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as for me, patroclus is</p>
    <p class=l>let not my palate know the taste of food,<br />till my insatiate rage be cloy’d with blood:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lying dead in my tent, all hacked and hewn, with his feet to the</p>
    <p class=l>pale lies my friend, with wounds disfigured o’er,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>door, and his comrades are mourning round him.</p>
    <p class=l>and his cold feet are pointed to the door.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore i can</p>
    <p class=l>revenge is all my soul!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>take thought of nothing save only slaughter and blood and the</p>
    <p class=l>no meaner care,<br />interest, or thought, has room to harbour there;<br />destruction be my feast, and mortal wounds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rattle in the throat of the dying.</p>
    <p class=l>and scenes of blood, and agonizing sounds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses answered, “achilles, son of peleus, mightiest of all the</p>
    <p class=l>“o first of greeks, (ulysses thus rejoin’d,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans, in battle you are better than i, and that more than a</p>
    <p class=l>the best and bravest of the warrior kind!<br />thy praise it is in dreadful camps to shine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>little, but in counsel i am much before you, for i am older and<br />of greater knowledge.</p>
    <p class=l>but old experience and calm wisdom mine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore be patient under my words.</p>
    <p class=l>then hear my counsel, and to reason yield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fighting is a thing of which men soon surfeit, and when jove, who</p>
    <p class=l>the bravest soon are satiate of the field;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is war’s steward, weighs the upshot, it may well prove that the<br />straw which our sickles have reaped is far heavier than the</p>
    <p class=l>though vast the heaps that strow the crimson plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grain.</p>
    <p class=l>the bloody harvest brings but little gain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it may not be that the achaeans should mourn the dead with</p>
    <p class=l>the scale of conquest ever wavering lies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their bellies; day by day men fall thick and threefold</p>
    <p class=l>great jove but turns it, and the victor dies!<br />the great, the bold, by thousands daily fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>continually; when should we have respite from our sorrow?</p>
    <p class=l>and endless were the grief, to weep for all.<br />eternal sorrows what avails to shed?<br />greece honours not with solemn fasts the dead:<br />enough, when death demands the brave, to pay</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us</p>
    <p class=l>the tribute of a melancholy day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mourn our dead for a day and bury them out of sight and mind, but</p>
    <p class=l>one chief with patience to the grave resign’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let those of us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and</p>
    <p class=l>our care devolves on others left behind.<br />let generous food supplies of strength produce,<br />let rising spirits flow from sprightly juice,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight our foes more fiercely.</p>
    <p class=l>let their warm heads with scenes of battle glow,<br />and pour new furies on the feebler foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in that hour let no man hold back,</p>
    <p class=l>yet a short interval, and none shall dare</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>waiting for a second summons; such summons shall bode ill for him</p>
    <p class=l>expect a second summons to the war;<br />who waits for that, the dire effects shall find,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who is found lagging behind at our ships; let us rather sally as</p>
    <p class=l>if trembling in the ships he lags behind.<br />embodied, to the battle let us bend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one man and loose the fury of war upon the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>and all at once on haughty troy descend.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of nestor, with</p>
    <p class=l>and now the delegates ulysses sent,<br />to bear the presents from the royal tent:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meges son of phyleus, thoas, meriones, lycomedes son of creontes,</p>
    <p class=l>the sons of nestor, phyleus’ valiant heir,<br />thias and merion, thunderbolts of war,<br />with lycomedes of creiontian strain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and melanippus, and went to the tent of agamemnon son of atreus.</p>
    <p class=l>and melanippus, form’d the chosen train.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the word was not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought</p>
    <p class=l>swift as the word was given, the youths obey’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>out the seven tripods which agamemnon had promised, with the</p>
    <p class=l>twice ten bright vases in the midst they laid;<br />a row of six fair tripods then succeeds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>twenty metal cauldrons and the twelve horses; they also brought</p>
    <p class=l>and twice the number of high-bounding steeds:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the women skilled in useful arts, seven in number, with briseis,</p>
    <p class=l>seven captives next a lovely line compose;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which made eight.</p>
    <p class=l>the eighth briseïs, like the blooming rose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses weighed out the ten talents of gold and</p>
    <p class=l>closed the bright band: great ithacus, before,<br />first of the train, the golden talents bore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then led the way back, while the young achaeans brought the rest</p>
    <p class=l>the rest in public view the chiefs dispose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the gifts, and laid them in the middle of the assembly.</p>
    <p class=l>a splendid scene!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon then rose, and talthybius whose voice was like that of</p>
    <p class=l>then agamemnon rose:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a god came to him with the boar.</p>
    <p class=l>the boar talthybius held: the grecian lord</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of atreus drew the knife<br />which he wore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by</p>
    <p class=l>drew the broad cutlass sheath’d beside his sword:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cutting off some bristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in</p>
    <p class=l>the stubborn bristles from the victim’s brow</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>prayer as he did so.</p>
    <p class=l>he crops, and offering meditates his vow.<br />his hands uplifted to the attesting skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the other achaeans sat where they were all</p>
    <p class=l>on heaven’s broad marble roof were fixed his eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>silent and orderly to hear the king, and agamemnon looked into</p>
    <p class=l>the solemn words a deep attention draw,<br />and greece around sat thrill’d with sacred awe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the vault of heaven and prayed saying, “i call jove the first and</p>
    <p class=l>“witness thou first!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mightiest of all gods to witness, i call also earth and sun and</p>
    <p class=l>thou greatest power above,<br />all-good, all-wise, and all-surveying jove!<br />and mother-earth, and heaven’s revolving light,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the erinyes who dwell below and take vengeance on him who shall</p>
    <p class=l>and ye, fell furies of the realms of night,<br />who rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare<br />for perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>swear falsely, that i have laid no hand upon the girl briseis,</p>
    <p class=l>the black-eyed maid inviolate removes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neither to take her to my bed nor otherwise, but that she has<br />remained in my tents inviolate.</p>
    <p class=l>pure and unconscious of my manly loves.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if i swear falsely may heaven</p>
    <p class=l>if this be false, heaven all its vengeance shed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>visit me with all the penalties which it metes out to those who</p>
    <p class=l>and levell’d thunder strike my guilty head!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>perjure themselves.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he cut the boar’s throat as he spoke, whereon talthybius whirled</p>
    <p class=l>with that, his weapon deep inflicts the wound;<br />the bleeding savage tumbles to the ground;<br />the sacred herald rolls the victim slain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it round his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed the<br />fishes.</p>
    <p class=l>(a feast for fish) into the foaming main.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then achilles also rose and said to the argives, “father<br />jove, of a truth you blind men’s eyes and bane them.</p>
    <p class=l>then thus achilles: “hear, ye greeks!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of</p>
    <p class=l>and know</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus had not else stirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so</p>
    <p class=l>whate’er we feel, ’tis jove inflicts the woe;<br />not else atrides could our rage inflame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stubbornly taken briseis from me against my will.</p>
    <p class=l>nor from my arms, unwilling, force the dame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>surely jove</p>
    <p class=l>’twas jove’s high will alone, o’erruling all,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>must have counselled the destruction of many an argive.</p>
    <p class=l>that doom’d our strife, and doom’d the greeks to fall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>go, now,</p>
    <p class=l>go then, ye chiefs!<br />indulge the genial rite;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and take your food that we may begin fighting.</p>
    <p class=l>achilles waits ye, and expects the fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his</p>
    <p class=l>the speedy council at his word adjourn’d:<br />to their black vessels all the greeks return’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>own ship.</p>
    <p class=l>achilles sought his tent.<br />his train before</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the myrmidons attended to the presents and took them</p>
    <p class=l>march’d onward, bending with the gifts they bore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>away to the ship of achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>those in the tents the squires industrious spread:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they placed them in his tents,</p>
    <p class=l>the foaming coursers to the stalls they led;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while the stable-men drove the horses in among the others.</p>
    <p class=l>to their new seats the female captives move.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>briseis, fair as venus, when she saw the mangled body of</p>
    <p class=l>briseïs, radiant as the queen of love,<br />slow as she pass’d, beheld with sad survey<br />where, gash’d with cruel wounds, patroclus lay.<br />prone on the body fell the heavenly fair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus, flung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing her<br />breast, her neck, and her lovely face with both her hands.</p>
    <p class=l>beat her sad breast, and tore her golden hair;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beautiful as a goddess she wept and said, “patroclus, dearest</p>
    <p class=l>all beautiful in grief, her humid eyes<br />shining with tears she lifts, and thus she cries:<br />“ah, youth for ever dear, for ever kind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>friend, when i went hence i left you living; i return, o prince,</p>
    <p class=l>once tender friend of my distracted mind!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to find you dead; thus do fresh sorrows multiply upon me one</p>
    <p class=l>i left thee fresh in life, in beauty gay;<br />now find thee cold, inanimated clay!<br />what woes my wretched race of life attend!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after the other.</p>
    <p class=l>sorrows on sorrows, never doom’d to end!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i saw him to whom my father and mother married</p>
    <p class=l>the first loved consort of my virgin bed</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me, cut down before our city, and my three own dear brothers</p>
    <p class=l>before these eyes in fatal battle bled:<br />my three brave brothers in one mournful day</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>perished with him on the self-same day; but you, patroclus, even</p>
    <p class=l>all trod the dark, irremeable way:<br />thy friendly hand uprear’d me from the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when achilles slew my husband and sacked the city of noble mynes,</p>
    <p class=l>and dried my sorrows for a husband slain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>told me that i was not to weep, for you said you would make</p>
    <p class=l>achilles’ care you promised i should prove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles marry me, and take me back with him to phthia, we should</p>
    <p class=l>the first, the dearest partner of his love;<br />that rites divine should ratify the band,<br />and make me empress in his native land.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have a wedding feast among the myrmidons.</p>
    <p class=l>accept these grateful tears!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you were always kind to</p>
    <p class=l>for thee they flow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me and i shall never cease to grieve for you.</p>
    <p class=l>for thee, that ever felt another’s woe!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making</p>
    <p class=l>her sister captives echoed groan for groan,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as though their tears were for patroclus, but in truth each was<br />weeping for her own sorrows.</p>
    <p class=l>nor mourn’d patroclus’ fortunes, but their own.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the elders of the achaeans gathered</p>
    <p class=l>the leaders press’d the chief on every side;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>round achilles and prayed him to take food, but he groaned and<br />would not do so.</p>
    <p class=l>unmoved he heard them, and with sighs denied.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“i pray you,” said he, “if any comrade will hear</p>
    <p class=l>“if yet achilles have a friend, whose care</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me, bid me neither eat nor drink, for i am in great heaviness,</p>
    <p class=l>is bent to please him, this request forbear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and will stay fasting even to the going down of the sun.</p>
    <p class=l>till yonder sun descend, ah, let me pay<br />to grief and anguish one abstemious day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons of</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, and from the warriors turn’d his face:<br />yet still the brother-kings of atreus’ race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus and ulysses, nestor, idomeneus, and the knight phoenix,</p>
    <p class=l>nestor, idomeneus, ulysses sage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who stayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of</p>
    <p class=l>and phœnix, strive to calm his grief and rage:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his sorrow: but he would not be comforted till he should have</p>
    <p class=l>his rage they calm not, nor his grief control;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flung himself into the jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on</p>
    <p class=l>he groans, he raves, he sorrows from his soul.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sigh, thinking ever of patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>“thou too, patroclus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he said—</p>
    <p class=l>(thus his heart he vents)<br />once spread the inviting banquet in our tents:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good</p>
    <p class=l>thy sweet society, thy winning care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dinner ready for me at once and without delay when the achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>once stay’d achilles, rushing to the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were hasting to fight the trojans; now, therefore, though i have</p>
    <p class=l>but now, alas!<br />to death’s cold arms resign’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meat and drink in my tents, yet will i fast for sorrow.</p>
    <p class=l>what banquet but revenge can glad my mind?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grief<br />greater than this i could not know, not even though i were to</p>
    <p class=l>what greater sorrow could afflict my breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hear of the death of my father, who is now in phthia weeping for</p>
    <p class=l>what more if hoary peleus were deceased?<br />who now, perhaps, in phthia dreads to hear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the loss of me his son, who am here fighting the trojans in a</p>
    <p class=l>his son’s sad fate, and drops a tender tear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strange land for the accursed sake of helen, nor yet though i</p>
    <p class=l>what more, should neoptolemus the brave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should hear that my son is no more—he who is being brought up in</p>
    <p class=l>my only offspring, sink into the grave?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>scyros—if indeed neoptolemus is still living.</p>
    <p class=l>if yet that offspring lives; (i distant far,<br />of all neglectful, wage a hateful war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>till now i made</p>
    <p class=l>)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sure that i alone was to fall here at troy away from argos, while</p>
    <p class=l>i could not this, this cruel stroke attend;<br />fate claim’d achilles, but might spare his friend.<br />i hoped patroclus might survive, to rear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you were to return to phthia, bring back my son with you in your</p>
    <p class=l>my tender orphan with a parent’s care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>own ship, and show him all my property, my bondsmen, and the</p>
    <p class=l>from scyros’ isle conduct him o’er the main,<br />and glad his eyes with his paternal reign,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>greatness of my house—for peleus must surely be either dead, or</p>
    <p class=l>the lofty palace, and the large domain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what little life remains to him is oppressed alike with the</p>
    <p class=l>for peleus breathes no more the vital air;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>infirmities of age and ever present fear lest he should hear the</p>
    <p class=l>or drags a wretched life of age and care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sad tidings of my death.</p>
    <p class=l>but till the news of my sad fate invades<br />his hastening soul, and sinks him to the shades.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each</p>
    <p class=l>sighing he said: his grief the heroes join’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thought on what he had left at home behind him.</p>
    <p class=l>each stole a tear for what he left behind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of saturn</p>
    <p class=l>their mingled grief the sire of heaven survey’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>looked down with pity upon them, and said presently to minerva,</p>
    <p class=l>and thus with pity to his blue-eyed maid:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“my child, you have quite deserted your hero; is he then gone so</p>
    <p class=l>“is then achilles now no more thy care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>clean out of your recollection?</p>
    <p class=l>and dost thou thus desert the great in war?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there he sits by the ships all</p>
    <p class=l>lo, where yon sails their canvas wings extend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>desolate for the loss of his dear comrade, and though the others<br />are gone to their dinner he will neither eat nor drink.</p>
    <p class=l>all comfortless he sits, and wails his friend:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>go then</p>
    <p class=l>ere thirst and want his forces have oppress’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and drop nectar and ambrosia into his breast, that he may know no</p>
    <p class=l>haste and infuse ambrosia in his breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hunger.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words he urged minerva, who was already of the same</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke; and sudden, at the word of jove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mind.</p>
    <p class=l>shot the descending goddess from above.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon</p>
    <p class=l>so swift through ether the shrill harpy springs,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sailing on his broad wings and screaming.</p>
    <p class=l>the wide air floating to her ample wings,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>to great achilles she her flight address’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were arming throughout the host, and when minerva had dropped</p>
    <p class=l>and pour’d divine ambrosia in his breast,[259]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nectar and ambrosia into achilles so that no cruel hunger should</p>
    <p class=l>with nectar sweet, (refection of the gods!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cause his limbs to fail him, she went back to the house of her</p>
    <p class=l>)<br />then, swift ascending, sought the bright abodes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty father.</p>
    <p class=l>now issued from the ships the warrior-train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thick as the chill snow-flakes shed from the hand</p>
    <p class=l>and like a deluge pour’d upon the plain.<br />as when the piercing blasts of boreas blow,<br />and scatter o’er the fields the driving snow;<br />from dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of jove and borne on the keen blasts of the north wind, even so</p>
    <p class=l>whose dazzling lustre whitens all the skies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thick did the gleaming helmets, the bossed shields, the strongly</p>
    <p class=l>so helms succeeding helms, so shields from shields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>plated breastplates, and the ashen spears stream from the ships.<br />the sheen pierced the sky, the whole land was radiant with their</p>
    <p class=l>catch the quick beams, and brighten all the fields;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flashing armour, and the sound of the tramp of their treading</p>
    <p class=l>broad glittering breastplates, spears with pointed rays,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rose from under their feet.</p>
    <p class=l>mix in one stream, reflecting blaze on blaze;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the midst of them all achilles put</p>
    <p class=l>thick beats the centre as the coursers bound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes gleamed like fire,</p>
    <p class=l>with splendour flame the skies, and laugh the fields around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for his grief was greater than he could bear.<br />thus, then, full of</p>
    <p class=l>full in the midst, high-towering o’er the rest,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fury against the trojans, did he don the gift of the god, the</p>
    <p class=l>his limbs in arms divine achilles dress’d;<br />arms which the father of the fire bestow’d,<br />forged on the eternal anvils of the god.<br />grief and revenge his furious heart inspire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>armour that vulcan had made him.</p>
    <p class=l>his glowing eyeballs roll with living fire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and</p>
    <p class=l>he grinds his teeth, and furious with delay<br />o’erlooks the embattled host, and hopes the bloody day.<br />the silver cuishes first his thighs infold;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>next he did on the breastplate about his chest.<br />he slung the</p>
    <p class=l>then o’er his breast was braced the hollow gold;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took</p>
    <p class=l>the brazen sword a various baldric tied,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>up the shield so great and strong that shone afar with a</p>
    <p class=l>that, starr’d with gems, hung glittering at his side;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>splendour as of the moon.</p>
    <p class=l>and, like the moon, the broad refulgent shield</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as the light seen by sailors from out</p>
    <p class=l>blazed with long rays, and gleam’d athwart the field.<br />so to night-wandering sailors, pale with fears,<br />wide o’er the watery waste, a light appears,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at sea, when men have lit a fire in their homestead high up among<br />the mountains, but the sailors are carried out to sea by wind and<br />storm far from the haven where they would be—even so did the</p>
    <p class=l>which on the far-seen mountain blazing high,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gleam of achilles’ wondrous shield strike up into the heavens.</p>
    <p class=l>streams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>with mournful eyes they gaze, and gaze again;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lifted the redoubtable helmet, and set it upon his head, from</p>
    <p class=l>loud howls the storm, and drives them o’er the main.<br />next, his high head the helmet graced; behind</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whence it shone like a star, and the golden plumes which vulcan</p>
    <p class=l>the sweepy crest hung floating in the wind:<br />like the red star, that from his flaming hair<br />shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war;<br />so stream’d the golden honours from his head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had set thick about the ridge of the helmet, waved all around it.</p>
    <p class=l>trembled the sparkling plumes, and the loose glories shed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then achilles made trial of himself in his armour to see whether</p>
    <p class=l>the chief beholds himself with wondering eyes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it fitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under it, and</p>
    <p class=l>his arms he poises, and his motions tries;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it seemed to buoy him up as though it had been wings.</p>
    <p class=l>buoy’d by some inward force, he seems to swim,<br />and feels a pinion lifting every limb.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he also drew his father’s spear out of the spear-stand, a spear</p>
    <p class=l>and now he shakes his great paternal spear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so great and heavy and strong that none of the achaeans save only</p>
    <p class=l>ponderous and huge, which not a greek could rear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles had strength to wield it; this was the spear of pelian<br />ash from the topmost ridges of mt.</p>
    <p class=l>from pelion’s cloudy top an ash entire</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pelion, which chiron had once</p>
    <p class=l>old chiron fell’d, and shaped it for his sire;<br />a spear which stern achilles only wields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>given to peleus, fraught with the death of heroes.</p>
    <p class=l>the death of heroes, and the dread of fields.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>automedon and</p>
    <p class=l>automedon and alcimus prepare</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alcimus busied themselves with the harnessing of his horses; they</p>
    <p class=l>the immortal coursers, and the radiant car;<br />(the silver traces sweeping at their side;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>made the bands fast about them, and put the bit in their mouths,</p>
    <p class=l>their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drawing the reins back towards the chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>the ivory-studded reins, return’d behind,<br />waved o’er their backs, and to the chariot join’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>automedon, whip in</p>
    <p class=l>the charioteer then whirl’d the lash around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hand, sprang up behind the horses, and after him achilles mounted</p>
    <p class=l>and swift ascended at one active bound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in full armour, resplendent as the sun-god hyperion.</p>
    <p class=l>all bright in heavenly arms, above his squire<br />achilles mounts, and sets the field on fire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then with a</p>
    <p class=l>not brighter phœbus in the ethereal way</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>loud voice he chided with his father’s horses saying, “xanthus</p>
    <p class=l>flames from his chariot, and restores the day.<br />high o’er the host, all terrible he stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and balius, famed offspring of podarge—this time when we have</p>
    <p class=l>and thunders to his steeds these dread commands:<br />“xanthus and balius!<br />of podarges’ strain,<br />(unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>done fighting be sure and bring your driver safely back to the</p>
    <p class=l>be swift, be mindful of the load ye bear,<br />and learn to make your master more your care:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>host of the achaeans, and do not leave him dead on the plain as</p>
    <p class=l>through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword,<br />nor, as ye left patroclus, leave your lord.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you did patroclus.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then fleet xanthus answered under the yoke—for white-armed juno</p>
    <p class=l>the generous xanthus, as the words he said,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had endowed him with human speech—and he bowed his head till his</p>
    <p class=l>seem’d sensible of woe, and droop’d his head:<br />trembling he stood before the golden wain,<br />and bow’d to dust the honours of his mane.<br />when, strange to tell!<br />(so juno will’d) he broke<br />eternal silence, and portentous spoke.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mane touched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band.</p>
    <p class=l>“achilles!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“dread achilles,” said he, “we will indeed save you now, but the</p>
    <p class=l>yes!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>day of your death is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it</p>
    <p class=l>this day at least we bear<br />thy rage in safety through the files of war:<br />but come it will, the fatal time must come,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will be heaven and stern fate that will destroy you.</p>
    <p class=l>not ours the fault, but god decrees thy doom.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neither was<br />it through any sloth or slackness on our part that the trojans</p>
    <p class=l>not through our crime, or slowness in the course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stripped patroclus of his armour; it was the mighty god whom</p>
    <p class=l>fell thy patroclus, but by heavenly force;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lovely leto bore that slew him as he fought among the foremost,</p>
    <p class=l>the bright far-shooting god who gilds the day</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and vouchsafed a triumph to hector.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans were triumphant, for achilles who had long refused</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forthwith uprose strong strife, rouser of hosts, and minerva</p>
    <p class=l>then tumult rose: fierce rage and pale affright<br />varied each face: then discord sounds alarms,<br />earth echoes, and the nations rush to arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>raised her loud voice, now standing by the deep trench that ran</p>
    <p class=l>now through the trembling shores minerva calls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>outside the wall, and now shouting with all her might upon the</p>

    <p class=l>mars hovering o’er his troy, his terror shrouds</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and called on the trojans</p>
    <p class=l>in gloomy tempests, and a night of clouds:</p>

    <p class=r>at the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and now speeding</p>
    <p class=l>now through each trojan heart he fury pours<br />with voice divine, from ilion’s topmost towers:<br />now shouts to simois, from her beauteous hill;</p>

    <p class=l>his dark dominions open to the day,<br />and pour in light on pluto’s drear abodes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ghastly grim that even the gods shudder to think of them.</p>

    <p class=r>as he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of his</p>
    <p class=l>this said, and spirit breathed into his breast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>people, and he strode in full armour among the ranks of the<br />foremost fighters.<br />nor did the son of anchises escape the notice</p>
    <p class=l>through the thick troops the embolden’d hero press’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of white-armed juno, as he went forth into the throng to meet</p>
    <p class=l>his venturous act the white-arm’d queen survey’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>and thus, assembling all the powers, she said:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she called the gods about her, and said, “look to it,</p>
    <p class=l>“behold an action, gods!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you two, neptune and minerva, and consider how this shall be;</p>
    <p class=l>that claims your care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>phoebus apollo has been sending aeneas clad in full armour to<br />fight achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>lo great æneas rushing to the war!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall we turn him back at once, or shall one of</p>
    <p class=l>against pelides he directs his course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>us stand by achilles and endow him with strength so that his</p>
    <p class=l>phœbus impels, and phœbus gives him force.</p>

    <p class=r>heart fail not, and he may learn that the chiefs of the immortals<br />are on his side, while the others who have all along been</p>
    <p class=l>restrain his bold career; at least, to attend</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>defending the trojans are but vain helpers?<br />let us all come down</p>
    <p class=l>our favour’d hero, let some power descend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from olympus and join in the fight, that this day he may take no</p>
    <p class=l>to guard his life, and add to his renown,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hurt at the hands of the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>we, the great armament of heaven, came down.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hereafter let him suffer</p>
    <p class=l>hereafter let him fall, as fates design,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whatever fate may have spun out for him when he was begotten and</p>
    <p class=l>that spun so short his life’s illustrious line:[262]<br />but lest some adverse god now cross his way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his mother bore him.</p>
    <p class=l>give him to know what powers assist this day:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if achilles be not thus assured by the voice</p>
    <p class=l>for how shall mortal stand the dire alarms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of a god, he may come to fear presently when one of us meets him<br />in battle, for the gods are terrible if they are seen face to</p>
    <p class=l>when heaven’s refulgent host appear in arms?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>face.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”[263]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, “juno,</p>
    <p class=l>thus she; and thus the god whose force can make<br />the solid globe’s eternal basis shake:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>restrain your fury; it is not well; i am not in favour of forcing</p>
    <p class=l>“against the might of man, so feeble known,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the other gods to fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on</p>
    <p class=l>why should celestial powers exert their own?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>our own side; let us take our places on some hill out of the</p>
    <p class=l>suffice from yonder mount to view the scene,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beaten track, and let mortals fight it out among themselves.</p>
    <p class=l>and leave to war the fates of mortal men.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if</p>
    <p class=l>but if the armipotent, or god of light,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mars or phoebus apollo begin fighting, or keep achilles in check</p>
    <p class=l>obstruct achilles, or commence the fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so that he cannot fight, we too, will at once raise the cry of</p>
    <p class=l>thence on the gods of troy we swift descend:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battle, and in that case they will soon leave the field and go</p>
    <p class=l>full soon, i doubt not, shall the conflict end;<br />and these, in ruin and confusion hurl’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>back vanquished to olympus among the other gods.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words the dark-haired god led the way to the high</p>
    <p class=l>thus having said, the tyrant of the sea,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>earth-barrow of hercules, built round solid masonry, and made by</p>
    <p class=l>coerulean neptune, rose, and led the way.<br />advanced upon the field there stood a mound<br />of earth congested, wall’d, and trench’d around;<br />in elder times to guard alcides made,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans and pallas minerva for him to fly to when the</p>
    <p class=l>(the work of trojans, with minerva’s aid,)<br />what time a vengeful monster of the main</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sea-monster was chasing him from the shore on to the plain.</p>
    <p class=l>swept the wide shore, and drove him to the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>here<br />neptune and those that were with him took their seats, wrapped in</p>
    <p class=l>here neptune and the gods of greece repair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a thick cloud of darkness; but the other gods seated themselves</p>
    <p class=l>with clouds encompass’d, and a veil of air:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on the brow of callicolone round you, o phoebus, and mars the</p>
    <p class=l>the adverse powers, around apollo laid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>waster of cities.</p>
    <p class=l>crown the fair hills that silver simois shade.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither</p>
    <p class=l>in circle close each heavenly party sat,<br />intent to form the future scheme of fate;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>side was willing to begin battle with the other, and jove from</p>
    <p class=l>but mix not yet in fight, though jove on high</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his seat on high was in command over them all.</p>
    <p class=l>gives the loud signal, and the heavens reply.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground;<br />the trampled centre yields a hollow sound:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whole plain was alive with men and horses, and blazing with the</p>
    <p class=l>steeds cased in mail, and chiefs in armour bright,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gleam of armour.</p>
    <p class=l>the gleaming champaign glows with brazen light.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the earth rang again under the tramp of their<br />feet as they rushed towards each other, and two champions, by far<br />the foremost of them all, met between the hosts to fight—to wit,</p>
    <p class=l>amid both hosts (a dreadful space) appear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas son of anchises, and noble achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>there great achilles; bold æneas, here.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmet</p>
    <p class=l>with towering strides æneas first advanced;<br />the nodding plumage on his helmet danced:<br />spread o’er his breast the fencing shield he bore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tossing defiance as he came on.</p>
    <p class=l>and, so he moved, his javelin flamed before.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he held his strong shield before</p>
    <p class=l>not so pelides; furious to engage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his breast, and brandished his bronze spear.</p>
    <p class=l>he rush’d impetuous.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of peleus</p>
    <p class=l>such the lion’s rage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from the other side sprang forth to meet him, like some fierce</p>
    <p class=l>who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lion that the whole country-side has met to hunt and kill—at</p>
    <p class=l>though all in arms the peopled city rise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first he bodes no ill, but when some daring youth has struck him</p>
    <p class=l>stalks careless on, with unregarding pride;<br />till at the length, by some brave youth defied,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with a spear, he crouches openmouthed, his jaws foam, he roars</p>
    <p class=l>to his bold spear the savage turns alone,<br />he murmurs fury with a hollow groan;<br />he grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with fury, he lashes his tail from side to side about his ribs</p>
    <p class=l>lash’d by his tail his heaving sides resound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and loins, and glares as he springs straight before him, to find</p>
    <p class=l>he calls up all his rage; he grinds his teeth,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>out whether he is to slay, or be slain among the foremost of his</p>
    <p class=l>resolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foes—even with such fury did achilles burn to spring upon aeneas.</p>
    <p class=l>so fierce achilles on æneas flies;<br />so stands æneas, and his force defies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they were now close up with one another achilles was first</p>
    <p class=l>ere yet the stern encounter join’d, begun</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to speak.</p>
    <p class=l>the seed of thetis thus to venus’ son:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“aeneas,” said he, “why do you stand thus out before</p>
    <p class=l>“why comes æneas through the ranks so far?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the host to fight me?</p>
    <p class=l>seeks he to meet achilles’ arm in war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is it that you hope to reign over the</p>
    <p class=l>in hope the realms of priam to enjoy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans in the seat of priam?</p>
    <p class=l>and prove his merits to the throne of troy?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nay, though you kill me priam will</p>
    <p class=l>grant that beneath thy lance achilles dies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not hand his kingdom over to you.</p>
    <p class=l>the partial monarch may refuse the prize;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he is a man of sound judgement,</p>
    <p class=l>sons he has many; those thy pride may quell:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and he has sons of his own.</p>
    <p class=l>and ’tis his fault to love those sons too well,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or have the trojans been allotting</p>
    <p class=l>or, in reward of thy victorious hand,<br />has troy proposed some spacious tract of land,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you a demesne of passing richness, fair with orchard lawns and</p>
    <p class=l>an ample forest, or a fair domain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>corn lands, if you should slay me?</p>
    <p class=l>of hills for vines, and arable for grain?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this you shall hardly do.</p>
    <p class=l>even this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i</p>
    <p class=l>but can achilles be so soon forgot?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have discomfited you once already.<br />have you forgotten how when</p>
    <p class=l>once (as i think) you saw this brandish’d spear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you were alone i chased you from your herds helter-skelter down</p>
    <p class=l>and then the great æneas seem’d to fear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the slopes of ida?</p>
    <p class=l>with hearty haste from ida’s mount he fled,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you did not turn round to look behind you; you</p>
    <p class=l>nor, till he reach’d lyrnessus, turn’d his head.<br />her lofty walls not long our progress stay’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>took refuge in lyrnessus, but i attacked the city, and with the<br />help of minerva and father jove i sacked it and carried its women</p>
    <p class=l>those, pallas, jove, and we, in ruins laid:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into captivity, though jove and the other gods rescued you.</p>
    <p class=l>in grecian chains her captive race were cast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you</p>
    <p class=l>’tis true, the great æneas fled too fast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>think they will protect you now, but they will not do so;</p>
    <p class=l>defrauded of my conquest once before,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore i say go back into the host, and do not face me, or you</p>
    <p class=l>what then i lost, the gods this day restore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will rue it.</p>
    <p class=l>go; while thou may’st, avoid the threaten’d fate;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even a fool may be wise after the event.</p>
    <p class=l>fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then aeneas answered, “son of peleus, think not that your words</p>
    <p class=l>to this anchises’ son: “such words employ</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can scare me as though i were a child.</p>
    <p class=l>to one that fears thee, some unwarlike boy;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i too, if i will, can brag</p>
    <p class=l>such we disdain; the best may be defied</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and talk unseemly.</p>
    <p class=l>with mean reproaches, and unmanly pride;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we know one another’s race and parentage as</p>
    <p class=l>unworthy the high race from which we came</p>

    <p class=l>proclaim’d so loudly by the voice of fame:</p>

    <p class=r>parents nor i yours.<br />men say that you are son to noble peleus,<br />and that your mother is thetis, fair-haired daughter of the sea.</p>
    <p class=l>each from illustrious fathers draws his line;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have noble anchises for my father, and venus for my mother; the</p>
    <p class=l>each goddess-born; half human, half divine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>parents of one or other of us shall this day mourn a son, for it</p>
    <p class=l>thetis’ this day, or venus’ offspring dies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will be more than silly talk that shall part us when the fight is</p>
    <p class=l>and tears shall trickle from celestial eyes:<br />for when two heroes, thus derived, contend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over.</p>
    <p class=l>’tis not in words the glorious strife can end.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>learn, then, my lineage if you will—and it is known to</p>

    <p class=l>(a tale resounded through the spacious earth)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dardania, for ilius was not yet stablished on the plain for men</p>
    <p class=l>dardania’s walls he raised; for ilion, then,<br />(the city since of many-languaged men,)<br />was not.</p>

    <p class=r>dardanus had a son, king erichthonius, who</p>
    <p class=l>from dardanus great erichthonius springs,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was wealthiest of all men living; he had three thousand mares</p>

    <p class=r>that fed by the water-meadows, they and their foals with them.</p>
    <p class=l>three thousand foals beside their mothers fed.</p>

    <p class=r>boreas was enamoured of them as they were feeding, and covered</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion.</p>

    <p class=r>go out and wrangle in the streets, one half true and the other</p>
    <p class=l>perhaps excel us in this wordy war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lies, as rage inspires them?</p>
    <p class=l>like us they stand, encompass’d with the crowd,<br />and vent their anger impotent and loud.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>no words of yours shall turn me now</p>
    <p class=l>cease then—our business in the field of fight</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that i am fain to fight—therefore let us make trial of one</p>
    <p class=l>is not to question, but to prove our might.<br />to all those insults thou hast offer’d here,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>another with our spears.</p>
    <p class=l>receive this answer: ’tis my flying spear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”<br />he spoke.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield</p>
    <p class=l>with all his force the javelin flung,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of achilles, which rang out as the point struck it.</p>
    <p class=l>fix’d deep, and loudly in the buckler rung.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of<br />peleus held the shield before him with his strong hand, and he</p>
    <p class=l>far on his outstretch’d arm, pelides held</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was afraid, for he deemed that aeneas’s spear would go through it</p>
    <p class=l>(to meet the thundering lance) his dreadful shield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quite easily, not reflecting that the god’s glorious gifts were</p>
    <p class=l>that trembled as it stuck; nor void of fear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>little likely to yield before the blows of mortal men; and indeed</p>
    <p class=l>saw, ere it fell, the immeasurable spear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas’s spear did not pierce the shield, for the layer of gold,</p>
    <p class=l>his fears were vain; impenetrable charms</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gift of the god, stayed the point.</p>
    <p class=l>secured the temper of the ethereal arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it went through two layers,</p>
    <p class=l>through two strong plates the point its passage held,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but the god had made the shield in five, two of bronze, the two</p>
    <p class=l>but stopp’d, and rested, by the third repell’d.<br />five plates of various metal, various mould,<br />composed the shield; of brass each outward fold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>innermost ones of tin, and one of gold; it was in this that the</p>
    <p class=l>of tin each inward, and the middle gold:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear was stayed.</p>
    <p class=l>there stuck the lance.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of aeneas</p>
    <p class=l>then rising ere he threw,<br />the forceful spear of great achilles flew,<br />and pierced the dardan shield’s extremest bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at the very edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of</p>
    <p class=l>where the shrill brass return’d a sharper sound:<br />through the thin verge the pelean weapon glides,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pelian ash went clean through, and the shield rang under the</p>
    <p class=l>and the slight covering of expanded hides.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>blow; aeneas was afraid, and crouched backwards, holding the</p>
    <p class=l>æneas his contracted body bends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shield away from him; the spear, however, flew over his back, and</p>
    <p class=l>and o’er him high the riven targe extends,<br />sees, through its parting plates, the upper air,<br />and at his back perceives the quivering spear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stuck quivering in the ground, after having gone through both</p>
    <p class=l>a fate so near him, chills his soul with fright;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>circles of the sheltering shield.</p>
    <p class=l>and swims before his eyes the many-colour’d light.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas though he had avoided<br />the spear, stood still, blinded with fear and grief because the</p>
    <p class=l>achilles, rushing in with dreadful cries,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>weapon had gone so near him; then achilles sprang furiously upon<br />him, with a cry as of death and with his keen blade drawn, and</p>
    <p class=l>draws his broad blade, and at æneas flies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas seized a great stone, so huge that two men, as men now</p>
    <p class=l>æneas rousing as the foe came on,<br />with force collected, heaves a mighty stone:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are, would be unable to lift it, but aeneas wielded it quite</p>
    <p class=l>a mass enormous!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>easily.</p>
    <p class=l>which in modern days</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas would then have struck achilles as he was springing</p>
    <p class=l>no two of earth’s degenerate sons could raise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>towards him, either on the helmet, or on the shield that covered</p>
    <p class=l>but ocean’s god, whose earthquakes rock the ground</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him, and achilles would have closed with him and despatched him</p>
    <p class=l>saw the distress, and moved the powers around:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with his sword, had not neptune lord of the earthquake been quick</p>
    <p class=l>“lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to mark, and said forthwith to the immortals, “alas, i am sorry</p>
    <p class=l>on the brink of fate æneas stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for great aeneas, who will now go down to the house of hades,</p>
    <p class=l>an instant victim to achilles’ hands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vanquished by the son of peleus.</p>
    <p class=l>by phœbus urged; but phœbus has bestow’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fool that he was to give ear to</p>
    <p class=l>his aid in vain: the man o’erpowers the god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the counsel of apollo.</p>
    <p class=l>and can ye see this righteous chief atone</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo will never save him from<br />destruction.<br />why should this man suffer when he is guiltless, to<br />no purpose, and in another’s quarrel?<br />has he not at all times</p>
    <p class=l>with guiltless blood for vices not his own?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>offered acceptable sacrifice to the gods that dwell in heaven?</p>
    <p class=l>to all the gods his constant vows were paid;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us then snatch him from death’s jaws, lest the son of saturn</p>
    <p class=l>sure, though he wars for troy, he claims our aid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be angry should achilles slay him.</p>
    <p class=l>fate wills not this; nor thus can jove resign</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it is fated, moreover, that he</p>
    <p class=l>the future father of the dardan line:[266]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should escape, and that the race of dardanus, whom jove loved</p>
    <p class=l>the first great ancestor obtain’d his grace,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>above all the sons born to him of mortal women, shall not perish</p>
    <p class=l>and still his love descends on all the race:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>utterly without seed or sign.</p>
    <p class=l>for priam now, and priam’s faithless kind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for now indeed has jove hated the</p>
    <p class=l>at length are odious to the all-seeing mind;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>blood of priam, while aeneas shall reign over the trojans, he and</p>
    <p class=l>on great æneas shall devolve the reign,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his children’s children that shall be born hereafter.</p>
    <p class=l>and sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then answered juno, “earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself,</p>
    <p class=l>the great earth-shaker thus: to whom replies</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and consider concerning aeneas, whether you will save him, or</p>
    <p class=l>the imperial goddess with the radiant eyes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>suffer him, brave though he be, to fall by the hand of achilles</p>
    <p class=l>“good as he is, to immolate or spare</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of peleus.</p>
    <p class=l>the dardan prince, o neptune!<br />be thy care;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for of a truth we two, i and pallas minerva, have<br />sworn full many a time before all the immortals, that never would</p>
    <p class=l>pallas and i, by all that gods can bind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we shield trojans from destruction, not even when all troy is</p>
    <p class=l>have sworn destruction to the trojan kind;<br />not even an instant to protract their fate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>burning in the flames that the achaeans shall kindle.</p>
    <p class=l>or save one member of the sinking state;<br />till her last flame be quench’d with her last gore,<br />and even her crumbling ruins are no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when earth-encircling neptune heard this he went into the battle</p>
    <p class=l>the king of ocean to the fight descends,<br />through all the whistling darts his course he bends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>amid the clash of spears, and came to the place where achilles</p>
    <p class=l>swift interposed between the warrior flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and aeneas were.<br />forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of</p>
    <p class=l>and casts thick darkness o’er achilles’ eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of peleus, drew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the</p>
    <p class=l>[267]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shield of aeneas, and laid it at the feet of achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>from great æneas’ shield the spear he drew,<br />and at his master’s feet the weapon threw.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he</p>
    <p class=l>that done, with force divine he snatch’d on high</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lifted aeneas on high from off the earth and hurried him away.</p>
    <p class=l>the dardan prince, and bore him through the sky,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over the heads of many a band of warriors both horse and foot did</p>
    <p class=l>smooth-gliding without step, above the heads</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he soar as the god’s hand sped him, till he came to the very</p>
    <p class=l>of warring heroes, and of bounding steeds:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fringe of the battle where the cauconians were arming themselves</p>
    <p class=l>till at the battle’s utmost verge they light,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for fight.</p>
    <p class=l>where the slow caucans close the rear of fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neptune, shaker of the earth, then came near to him</p>
    <p class=l>the godhead there (his heavenly form confess’d)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and said, “aeneas, what god has egged you on to this folly in</p>
    <p class=l>with words like these the panting chief address’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fighting the son of peleus, who is both a mightier man of valour</p>
    <p class=l>“what power, o prince!<br />with force inferior far,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and more beloved of heaven than you are?</p>
    <p class=l>urged thee to meet achilles’ arm in war?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>give way before him</p>
    <p class=l>henceforth beware, nor antedate thy doom,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whensoever you meet him, lest you go down to the house of hades</p>
    <p class=l>defrauding fate of all thy fame to come.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even though fate would have it otherwise.</p>
    <p class=l>but when the day decreed (for come it must)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when achilles is dead</p>
    <p class=l>shall lay this dreadful hero in the dust,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you may then fight among the foremost undaunted, for none other</p>
    <p class=l>let then the furies of that arm be known,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the achaeans shall slay you.</p>
    <p class=l>secure no grecian force transcends thy own.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the god left him when he had given him these instructions, and at</p>
    <p class=l>with that, he left him wondering as he lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>once removed the darkness from before the eyes of achilles, who</p>
    <p class=l>then from achilles chased the mist away:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>opened them wide indeed and said in great anger, “alas!</p>
    <p class=l>sudden, returning with a stream of light,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what</p>
    <p class=l>the scene of war came rushing on his sight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>marvel am i now beholding?</p>
    <p class=l>then thus, amazed; “what wonders strike my mind!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>here is my spear upon the ground, but</p>
    <p class=l>my spear, that parted on the wings of wind,<br />laid here before me!<br />and the dardan lord,<br />that fell this instant, vanish’d from my sword!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i see not him whom i meant to kill when i hurled it.<br />of a truth</p>
    <p class=l>i thought alone with mortals to contend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aeneas also must be under heaven’s protection, although i had</p>
    <p class=l>but powers celestial sure this foe defend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thought his boasting was idle.<br />let him go hang; he will be in no<br />mood to fight me further, seeing how narrowly he has missed being</p>
    <p class=l>great as he is, our arms he scarce will try,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>killed.</p>
    <p class=l>content for once, with all his gods, to fly.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will now give my orders to the danaans and attack some<br />other of the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>now then let others bleed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>” this said, aloud</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he did</p>
    <p class=l>he vents his fury and inflames the crowd:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so.</p>
    <p class=l>“o greeks!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“let not the trojans,” he cried, “keep you at arm’s length,</p>
    <p class=l>(he cries, and every rank alarms)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans, but go for them and fight them man for man.</p>
    <p class=l>join battle, man to man, and arms to arms!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>however</p>
    <p class=l>’tis not in me, though favour’d by the sky,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>valiant i may be, i cannot give chase to so many and fight all of</p>
    <p class=l>to mow whole troops, and make whole armies fly:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them.</p>
    <p class=l>no god can singly such a host engage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even mars, who is an immortal, or minerva, would shrink<br />from flinging himself into the jaws of such a fight and laying</p>
    <p class=l>not mars himself, nor great minerva’s rage.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about him; nevertheless, so far as in me lies i will show no</p>
    <p class=l>but whatsoe’er achilles can inspire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>slackness of hand or foot nor want of endurance, not even for a</p>
    <p class=l>whate’er of active force, or acting fire;<br />whate’er this heart can prompt, or hand obey;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moment; i will utterly break their ranks, and woe to the trojan</p>
    <p class=l>all, all achilles, greeks!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who shall venture within reach of my spear.</p>
    <p class=l>is yours to-day.<br />through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear,<br />and thin the squadrons with my single spear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he exhort them.</p>
    <p class=l>he said: nor less elate with martial joy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile hector called upon the trojans</p>
    <p class=l>the godlike hector warm’d the troops of troy:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and declared that he would fight achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>“trojans, to war!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“be not afraid, proud</p>
    <p class=l>think, hector leads you on;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans,” said he, “to face the son of peleus; i could fight gods</p>
    <p class=l>nor dread the vaunts of peleus’ haughty son.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>myself if the battle were one of words only, but they would be<br />more than a match for me, if we had to use our spears.</p>
    <p class=l>deeds must decide our fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so</p>
    <p class=l>e’en these with words</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the deed of achilles will fall somewhat short of his word; he</p>
    <p class=l>insult the brave, who tremble at their swords:<br />the weakest atheist-wretch all heaven defies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will do in part, and the other part he will clip short.</p>
    <p class=l>but shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will go</p>
    <p class=l>nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>up against him though his hands be as fire—though his hands be</p>
    <p class=l>not though his heart were steel, his hands were fire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fire and his strength iron.</p>
    <p class=l>that fire, that steel, your hector should withstand,<br />and brave that vengeful heart, that dreadful hand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus urged the trojans lifted up their spears against the</p>
    <p class=l>thus (breathing rage through all) the hero said;<br />a wood of lances rises round his head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans, and raised the cry of battle as they flung themselves</p>
    <p class=l>clamours on clamours tempest all the air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into the midst of their ranks.</p>
    <p class=l>they join, they throng, they thicken to the war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but phoebus apollo came up to<br />hector and said, “hector, on no account must you challenge</p>
    <p class=l>but phœbus warns him from high heaven to shun</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles to single combat; keep a look-out for him while you are</p>
    <p class=l>the single fight with thetis’ godlike son;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>under cover of the others and away from the thick of the fight,<br />otherwise he will either hit you with a spear or cut you down at</p>
    <p class=l>more safe to combat in the mingled band,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>close quarters.</p>
    <p class=l>nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”<br />thus he spoke, and hector drew back within the crowd, for he was<br />afraid when he heard what the god had said to him.</p>
    <p class=l>he hears, obedient to the god of light,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles then</p>
    <p class=l>and, plunged within the ranks, awaits the fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sprang upon the trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as</p>
    <p class=l>then fierce achilles, shouting to the skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with a garment.</p>
    <p class=l>on troy’s whole force with boundless fury flies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first he killed iphition son of otrynteus, a</p>
    <p class=l>first falls iphytion, at his army’s head;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>leader of much people whom a naiad nymph had borne to otrynteus</p>
    <p class=l>brave was the chief, and brave the host he led;<br />from great otrynteus he derived his blood,<br />his mother was a nais, of the flood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>waster of cities, in the land of hyde under the snowy heights of<br />mt.</p>
    <p class=l>beneath the shades of tmolus, crown’d with snow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tmolus.</p>
    <p class=l>from hyde’s walls he ruled the lands below.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles struck him full on the head as he was coming</p>
    <p class=l>fierce as he springs, the sword his head divides:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on towards him, and split it clean in two; whereon he fell</p>
    <p class=l>the parted visage falls on equal sides:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heavily to the ground and achilles vaunted over him saying, “you</p>
    <p class=l>with loud-resounding arms he strikes the plain;<br />while thus achilles glories o’er the slain:<br />“lie there, otryntides!<br />the trojan earth</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be low, son of otrynteus, mighty hero; your death is here, but</p>
    <p class=l>receives thee dead, though gygae boast thy birth;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your lineage is on the gygaean lake where your father’s estate</p>
    <p class=l>those beauteous fields where hyllus’ waves are roll’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lies, by hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddying waters of hermus.</p>
    <p class=l>and plenteous hermus swells with tides of gold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>are thine no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other.</p>
    <p class=l>”—the insulting hero said,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>and left him sleeping in eternal shade.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariots of the achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over</p>
    <p class=l>the rolling wheels of greece the body tore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him in the front of the battle, and after him achilles killed</p>
    <p class=l>and dash’d their axles with no vulgar gore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>demoleon, a valiant man of war and son to antenor.</p>
    <p class=l>demoleon next, antenor’s offspring, laid<br />breathless in dust, the price of rashness paid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he struck him</p>
    <p class=l>the impatient steel with full-descending sway</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on the temple through his bronze-cheeked helmet.</p>
    <p class=l>forced through his brazen helm its furious way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the helmet did<br />not stay the spear, but it went right on, crushing the bone so</p>
    <p class=l>resistless drove the batter’d skull before,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that the brain inside was shed in all directions, and his lust of<br />fighting was ended.</p>
    <p class=l>and dash’d and mingled all the brains with gore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he struck hippodamas in the midriff as</p>
    <p class=l>this sees hippodamas, and seized with fright,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was springing down from his chariot in front of him, and</p>
    <p class=l>deserts his chariot for a swifter flight:<br />the lance arrests him: an ignoble wound</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trying to escape.</p>
    <p class=l>the panting trojan rivets to the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he breathed his last, bellowing like a bull</p>
    <p class=l>he groans away his soul: not louder roars,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bellows when young men are dragging him to offer him in sacrifice</p>
    <p class=l>at neptune’s shrine on helicè’s high shores,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to the king of helice, and the heart of the earth-shaker is glad;</p>
    <p class=l>the victim bull; the rocks re-bellow round,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so did he bellow as he lay dying.</p>
    <p class=l>and ocean listens to the grateful sound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles then went in<br />pursuit of polydorus son of priam, whom his father had always</p>
    <p class=l>then fell on polydore his vengeful rage,[268]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forbidden to fight because he was the youngest of his sons, the</p>
    <p class=l>the youngest hope of priam’s stooping age:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one he loved best, and the fastest runner.</p>
    <p class=l>(whose feet for swiftness in the race surpass’d:)<br />of all his sons, the dearest, and the last.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he, in his folly and</p>
    <p class=l>to the forbidden field he takes his flight,<br />in the first folly of a youthful knight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>showing off the fleetness of his feet, was rushing about among</p>
    <p class=l>to vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>front ranks until he lost his life, for achilles struck him in</p>
    <p class=l>but vaunts not long, with all his swiftness slain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the middle of the back as he was darting past him: he struck him</p>
    <p class=l>struck where the crossing belts unite behind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>just at the golden fastenings of his belt and where the two<br />pieces of the double breastplate overlapped.</p>
    <p class=l>and golden rings the double back-plate join’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the point of the</p>
    <p class=l>forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear pierced him through and came out by the navel, whereon he</p>
    <p class=l>and on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fell groaning on to his knees and a cloud of darkness</p>
    <p class=l>the rushing entrails pour’d upon the ground</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>overshadowed him as he sank holding his entrails in his hands.</p>
    <p class=l>his hands collect; and darkness wraps him round.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when hector saw his brother polydorus with his entrails in his</p>
    <p class=l>when hector view’d, all ghastly in his gore,<br />thus sadly slain the unhappy polydore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hands and sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his</p>
    <p class=l>a cloud of sorrow overcast his sight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eyes, and he could not bear to keep longer at a distance; he</p>
    <p class=l>his soul no longer brook’d the distant fight:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore poised his spear and darted towards achilles like a</p>
    <p class=l>full in achilles’ dreadful front he came,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flame of fire.</p>
    <p class=l>and shook his javelin like a waving flame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when achilles saw him he bounded forward and</p>
    <p class=l>the son of peleus sees, with joy possess’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vaunted saying, “this is he that has wounded my heart most deeply</p>
    <p class=l>his heart high-bounding in his rising breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and has slain my beloved comrade.</p>
    <p class=l>“and, lo!<br />the man on whom black fates attend;<br />the man, that slew achilles, is his friend!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not for long shall we two quail</p>
    <p class=l>no more shall hector’s and pelides’ spear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>before one another on the highways of war.</p>
    <p class=l>turn from each other in the walks of war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”—</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he looked fiercely on hector and said, “draw near, that you may</p>
    <p class=l>then with revengeful eyes he scann’d him o’er:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meet your doom the sooner.</p>
    <p class=l>“come, and receive thy fate!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>” hector feared him not and answered,</p>
    <p class=l>” he spake no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“son of peleus, think not that your words can scare me as though</p>
    <p class=l>hector, undaunted, thus: “such words employ</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i were a child; i too if i will can brag and talk unseemly; i</p>
    <p class=l>to one that dreads thee, some unwarlike boy:<br />such we could give, defying and defied,<br />mean intercourse of obloquy and pride!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>know that you are a mighty warrior, mightier by far than i,</p>
    <p class=l>i know thy force to mine superior far;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevertheless the issue lies in the lap of heaven whether i, worse</p>
    <p class=l>but heaven alone confers success in war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>man though i be, may not slay you with my spear, for this too has</p>
    <p class=l>mean as i am, the gods may guide my dart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>been found keen ere now.</p>
    <p class=l>and give it entrance in a braver heart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he hurled his spear as he spoke, but minerva breathed upon it,<br />and though she breathed but very lightly she turned it back from</p>
    <p class=l>then parts the lance: but pallas’ heavenly breath</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>going towards achilles, so that it returned to hector and lay at</p>
    <p class=l>far from achilles wafts the winged death:<br />the bidden dart again to hector flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his feet in front of him.</p>
    <p class=l>and at the feet of its great master lies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles then sprang furiously on him</p>
    <p class=l>achilles closes with his hated foe,<br />his heart and eyes with flaming fury glow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with a loud cry, bent on killing him, but apollo caught him up</p>
    <p class=l>but present to his aid, apollo shrouds</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>easily as a god can, and hid him in a thick darkness.</p>
    <p class=l>the favour’d hero in a veil of clouds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thrice did</p>
    <p class=l>thrice struck pelides with indignant heart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles spring towards him spear in hand, and thrice did he<br />waste his blow upon the air.<br />when he rushed forward for the</p>
    <p class=l>thrice in impassive air he plunged the dart;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fourth time as though he were a god, he shouted aloud saying,</p>
    <p class=l>the spear a fourth time buried in the cloud.<br />he foams with fury, and exclaims aloud:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“hound, this time too you have escaped death—but of a truth it</p>
    <p class=l>“wretch!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came exceedingly near you.<br />phoebus apollo, to whom it seems you</p>
    <p class=l>thou hast ’scaped again; once more thy flight</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pray before you go into battle, has again saved you; but if i too</p>
    <p class=l>has saved thee, and the partial god of light.<br />but long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have any friend among the gods i will surely make an end of you</p>
    <p class=l>if any power assist achilles’ hand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when i come across you at some other time.</p>
    <p class=l>fly then inglorious!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, however, i will</p>
    <p class=l>but thy flight this day</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pursue and overtake other trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>whole hecatombs of trojan ghosts shall pay.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this he struck dryops with his spear, about the middle of his</p>
    <p class=l>with that, he gluts his rage on numbers slain:<br />then dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neck, and he fell headlong at his feet.<br />there he let him lie and</p>
    <p class=l>pierced through the neck: he left him panting there,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stayed demouchus son of philetor, a man both brave and of great</p>
    <p class=l>and stopp’d demuchus, great philetor’s heir.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stature, by hitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote</p>
    <p class=l>gigantic chief!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him with his sword and killed him.</p>
    <p class=l>deep gash’d the enormous blade,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after this he sprang on</p>
    <p class=l>and for the soul an ample passage made.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>laogonus and dardanus, sons of bias, and threw them from their</p>
    <p class=l>laoganus and dardanus expire,<br />the valiant sons of an unhappy sire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariot, the one with a blow from a thrown spear, while the other</p>
    <p class=l>both in one instant from the chariot hurl’d,<br />sunk in one instant to the nether world:<br />this difference only their sad fates afford</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he cut down in hand-to-hand fight.</p>
    <p class=l>that one the spear destroy’d, and one the sword.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there was also tros the son of</p>
    <p class=l>nor less unpitied, young alastor bleeds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alastor—he came up to achilles and clasped his knees in the hope</p>
    <p class=l>in vain his youth, in vain his beauty pleads;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that he would spare him and not kill him but let him go, because</p>
    <p class=l>in vain he begs thee, with a suppliant’s moan,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were both of the same age.</p>
    <p class=l>to spare a form, an age so like thy own!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fool, he might have known that he</p>
    <p class=l>unhappy boy!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should not prevail with him, for the man was in no mood for pity</p>
    <p class=l>no prayer, no moving art,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or forbearance but was in grim earnest.</p>
    <p class=l>e’er bent that fierce, inexorable heart!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore when tros laid<br />hold of his knees and sought a hearing for his prayers, achilles</p>
    <p class=l>while yet he trembled at his knees, and cried,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drove his sword into his liver, and the liver came rolling out,</p>
    <p class=l>the ruthless falchion oped his tender side;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while his bosom was all covered with the black blood that welled<br />from the wound.</p>
    <p class=l>the panting liver pours a flood of gore</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did death close his eyes as he lay lifeless.</p>
    <p class=l>that drowns his bosom till he pants no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles then went up to mulius and struck him on the ear with a</p>
    <p class=l>through mulius’ head then drove the impetuous spear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear, and the bronze spear-head came right out at the other ear.</p>
    <p class=l>the warrior falls, transfix’d from ear to ear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he also struck echeclus son of agenor on the head with his sword,</p>
    <p class=l>thy life, echeclus!<br />next the sword bereaves,<br />deep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which became warm with the blood, while death and stern fate</p>
    <p class=l>warm’d in the brain the smoking weapon lies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>closed the eyes of echeclus.</p>
    <p class=l>the purple death comes floating o’er his eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>next in order the bronze point of</p>
    <p class=l>then brave deucalion died: the dart was flung</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his spear wounded deucalion in the fore-arm where the sinews of</p>
    <p class=l>where the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung;<br />he dropp’d his arm, an unassisting weight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the elbow are united, whereon he waited achilles’ onset with his</p>
    <p class=l>and stood all impotent, expecting fate:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>arm hanging down and death staring him in the face.<br />achilles cut</p>
    <p class=l>full on his neck the falling falchion sped,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his head off with a blow from his sword and flung it helmet and</p>
    <p class=l>from his broad shoulders hew’d his crested head:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all away from him, and the marrow came oozing out of his backbone</p>
    <p class=l>forth from the bone the spinal marrow flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he lay.</p>
    <p class=l>and, sunk in dust, the corpse extended lies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then went in pursuit of rhigmus, noble son of</p>
    <p class=l>rhigmas, whose race from fruitful thracia came,<br />(the son of pierus, an illustrious name,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>peires, who had come from fertile thrace, and struck him through<br />the middle with a spear which fixed itself in his belly, so that</p>
    <p class=l>succeeds to fate: the spear his belly rends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he fell headlong from his chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>prone from his car the thundering chief descends.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he also speared areithous</p>
    <p class=l>the squire, who saw expiring on the ground</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>squire to rhigmus in the back as he was turning his horses in</p>
    <p class=l>his prostrate master, rein’d the steeds around;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flight, and thrust him from his chariot, while the horses were</p>
    <p class=l>his back, scarce turn’d, the pelian javelin gored,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>struck with panic.</p>
    <p class=l>and stretch’d the servant o’er his dying lord.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought—and the</p>
    <p class=l>as when a flame the winding valley fills,<br />and runs on crackling shrubs between the hills;<br />then o’er the stubble up the mountain flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues</p>
    <p class=l>fires the high woods, and blazes to the skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of fire in every direction—even so furiously did achilles rage,</p>
    <p class=l>this way and that, the spreading torrent roars:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wielding his spear as though he were a god, and giving chase to</p>
    <p class=l>so sweeps the hero through the wasted shores;<br />around him wide, immense destruction pours</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>those whom he would slay, till the dark earth ran with blood.</p>
    <p class=l>and earth is deluged with the sanguine showers,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or<br />as one who yokes broad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in</p>
    <p class=l>as with autumnal harvests cover’d o’er,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a threshing-floor—and it is soon bruised small under the feet of</p>
    <p class=l>and thick bestrewn, lies ceres’ sacred floor;<br />when round and round, with never-wearied pain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the lowing cattle—even so did the horses of achilles trample on</p>
    <p class=l>the trampling steers beat out the unnumber’d grain:<br />so the fierce coursers, as the chariot rolls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the shields and bodies of the slain.</p>
    <p class=l>tread down whole ranks, and crush out heroes’ souls,</p>

    <p class=r>railing that ran round the car were bespattered with clots of</p>
    <p class=l>black, bloody drops the smoking chariot dye:<br />the spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore;<br />and thick the groaning axles dropp’d with gore.<br />high o’er the scene of death achilles stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>blood thrown up by the horses’ hoofs, and from the tyres of the</p>
    <p class=l>all grim with dust, all horrible in blood:</p>

    <p class=r>wheels; but the son of peleus pressed on to win still further</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with gore.</p>

    <p class=l>stand, and is conveyed away in a cloud by apollo; who (to delude<br />achilles) takes upon him agenor’s shape, and while he pursues him in<br />that disguise, gives the trojans an opportunity of retiring into their</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stay them.</p>
    <p class=l>city.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the other half were hemmed in by the deep</p>
    <p class=l>the same day continues.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>silver-eddying stream, and fell into it with a great uproar.</p>
    <p class=l>the scene is on the banks and in the stream</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>of scamander.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>waters resounded, and the banks rang again, as they swam hither</p>
    <p class=l>and now to xanthus’ gliding stream they drove,<br />xanthus, immortal progeny of jove.<br />the river here divides the flying train,<br />part to the town fly diverse o’er the plain,<br />where late their troops triumphant bore the fight,<br />now chased, and trembling in ignoble flight:<br />(these with a gathered mist saturnia shrouds,<br />and rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds:)<br />part plunge into the stream: old xanthus roars,<br />the flashing billows beat the whiten’d shores:<br />with cries promiscuous all the banks resound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and thither with loud cries amid the whirling eddies.</p>
    <p class=l>and here, and there, in eddies whirling round,<br />the flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as locusts</p>
    <p class=l>as the scorch’d locusts from their fields retire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flying to a river before the blast of a grass fire—the flame</p>
    <p class=l>while fast behind them runs the blaze of fire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>comes on and on till at last it overtakes them and they huddle</p>
    <p class=l>driven from the land before the smoky cloud,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into the water—even so was the eddying stream of xanthus filled</p>
    <p class=l>the clustering legions rush into the flood:<br />so, plunged in xanthus by achilles’ force,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with the uproar of men and horses, all struggling in confusion</p>
    <p class=l>roars the resounding surge with men and horse.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>before achilles.<br />forthwith the hero left his spear upon the bank, leaning it</p>
    <p class=l>his bloody lance the hero casts aside,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against a tamarisk bush, and plunged into the river like a god,</p>
    <p class=l>(which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,)<br />then, like a god, the rapid billows braves,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>armed with his sword only.</p>
    <p class=l>arm’d with his sword, high brandish’d o’er the waves:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fell was his purpose as he hewed the</p>
    <p class=l>now down he plunges, now he whirls it round,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans down on every side.</p>
    <p class=l>deep groan’d the waters with the dying sound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their dying groans rose hideous as</p>
    <p class=l>repeated wounds the reddening river dyed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sword smote them, and the river ran red with blood.</p>
    <p class=l>and the warm purple circled on the tide.<br />swift through the foamy flood the trojans fly,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when</p>
    <p class=l>and close in rocks or winding caverns lie:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fish fly scared before a huge dolphin, and fill every nook and</p>
    <p class=l>so the huge dolphin tempesting the main,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>corner of some fair haven—for he is sure to eat all he can</p>
    <p class=l>in shoals before him fly the scaly train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>catch—even so did the trojans cower under the banks of the mighty</p>
    <p class=l>confusedly heap’d they seek their inmost caves,<br />or pant and heave beneath the floating waves.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>river, and when achilles’ arms grew weary with killing them, he</p>
    <p class=l>now, tired with slaughter, from the trojan band</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drew twelve youths alive out of the water, to sacrifice in<br />revenge for patroclus son of menoetius.</p>
    <p class=l>twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he drew them out like<br />dazed fawns, bound their hands behind them with the girdles of</p>
    <p class=l>with their rich belts their captive arms restrains</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their own shirts, and gave them over to his men to take back to</p>
    <p class=l>(late their proud ornaments, but now their chains).</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ships.</p>
    <p class=l>these his attendants to the ships convey’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he sprang into the river, thirsting for still</p>
    <p class=l>sad victims destined to patroclus’ shade;<br />then, as once more he plunged amid the flood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>further blood.</p>
    <p class=l>the young lycaon in his passage stood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there he found lycaon, son of priam seed of dardanus, as he was</p>
    <p class=l>the son of priam; whom the hero’s hand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>escaping out of the water; he it was whom he had once taken<br />prisoner when he was in his father’s vineyard, having set upon</p>
    <p class=l>but late made captive in his father’s land</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him by night, as he was cutting young shoots from a wild fig-tree</p>
    <p class=l>(as from a sycamore, his sounding steel</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to make the wicker sides of a chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>lopp’d the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles then caught him<br />to his sorrow unawares, and sent him by sea to lemnos, where the</p>
    <p class=l>to lemnos’ isle he sold the royal slave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of jason bought him.</p>
    <p class=l>where jason’s son the price demanded gave;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but a guest-friend, eetion of imbros,</p>
    <p class=l>but kind eetion, touching on the shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>freed him with a great sum, and sent him to arisbe, whence he had</p>
    <p class=l>the ransom’d prince to fair arisbe bore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>escaped and returned to his father’s house.<br />he had spent eleven<br />days happily with his friends after he had come from lemnos, but</p>
    <p class=l>ten days were past, since in his father’s reign</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on the twelfth heaven again delivered him into the hands of</p>
    <p class=l>he felt the sweets of liberty again;<br />the next, that god whom men in vain withstand<br />gives the same youth to the same conquering hand<br />now never to return!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles, who was to send him to the house of hades sorely</p>
    <p class=l>and doom’d to go</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against his will.</p>
    <p class=l>a sadder journey to the shades below.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was unarmed when achilles caught sight of</p>
    <p class=l>his well-known face when great achilles eyed,<br />(the helm and visor he had cast aside<br />with wild affright, and dropp’d upon the field</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him, and had neither helmet nor shield; nor yet had he any spear,</p>
    <p class=l>his useless lance and unavailing shield,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for he had thrown all his armour from him on to the bank, and was</p>
    <p class=l>as trembling, panting, from the stream he fled,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sweating with his struggles to get out of the river, so that his</p>
    <p class=l>and knock’d his faltering knees, the hero said:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strength was now failing him.</p>
    <p class=l>“ye mighty gods!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then achilles said to himself in his surprise, “what marvel do i</p>
    <p class=l>what wonders strike my view!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see here?</p>
    <p class=l>is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if this man can come back alive after having been sold</p>
    <p class=l>sure i shall see yon heaps of trojans kill’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over into lemnos, i shall have the trojans also whom i have slain</p>
    <p class=l>rise from the shades, and brave me on the field;<br />as now the captive, whom so late i bound</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rising from the world below.</p>
    <p class=l>and sold to lemnos, stalks on trojan ground!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>could not even the waters of the</p>
    <p class=l>not him the sea’s unmeasured deeps detain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grey sea imprison him, as they do many another whether he will or</p>
    <p class=l>that bar such numbers from their native plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>no?</p>
    <p class=l>lo!<br />he returns.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this time let him taste my spear, that i may know for certain</p>
    <p class=l>try, then, my flying spear!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whether mother earth who can keep even a strong man down, will be</p>
    <p class=l>try, if the grave can hold the wanderer;<br />if earth, at length this active prince can seize,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>able to hold him, or whether thence too he will return.</p>
    <p class=l>earth, whose strong grasp has held down hercules.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he pause and ponder.</p>
    <p class=l>thus while he spoke, the trojan pale with fears</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but lycaon came up to him dazed and</p>
    <p class=l>approach’d, and sought his knees with suppliant tears</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trying hard to embrace his knees, for he would fain live, not</p>
    <p class=l>loth as he was to yield his youthful breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>die.</p>
    <p class=l>and his soul shivering at the approach of death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles thrust at him with his spear, meaning to kill him,</p>
    <p class=l>achilles raised the spear, prepared to wound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but lycaon ran crouching up to him and caught his knees, whereby</p>
    <p class=l>he kiss’d his feet, extended on the ground:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the spear passed over his back, and stuck in the ground,</p>
    <p class=l>and while, above, the spear suspended stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hungering though it was for blood.</p>
    <p class=l>longing to dip its thirsty point in blood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with one hand he caught<br />achilles’ knees as he besought him, and with the other he<br />clutched the spear and would not let it go.</p>
    <p class=l>one hand embraced them close, one stopp’d the dart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he said,</p>
    <p class=l>while thus these melting words attempt his heart:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“achilles, have mercy upon me and spare me, for i am your</p>
    <p class=l>“thy well-known captive, great achilles!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>suppliant.</p>
    <p class=l>see,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it was in your tents that i first broke bread on the</p>
    <p class=l>once more lycaon trembles at thy knee.<br />some pity to a suppliant’s name afford,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>day when you took me prisoner in the vineyard; after which you</p>
    <p class=l>who shared the gifts of ceres at thy board;<br />whom late thy conquering arm to lemnos bore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sold me away to lemnos far from my father and my friends, and i</p>
    <p class=l>far from his father, friends, and native shore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brought you the price of a hundred oxen.</p>
    <p class=l>a hundred oxen were his price that day,<br />now sums immense thy mercy shall repay.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have paid three times</p>
    <p class=l>scarce respited from woes i yet appear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as much to gain my freedom; it is but twelve days that i have</p>
    <p class=l>and scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come to ilius after much suffering, and now cruel fate has again</p>
    <p class=l>lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thrown me into your hands.<br />surely father jove must hate me, that</p>
    <p class=l>jove again submits me to thy hands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he has given me over to you a second time.</p>
    <p class=l>again, her victim cruel fate demands!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>short of life indeed</p>
    <p class=l>i sprang from priam, and laothoe fair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did my mother laothoe bear me, daughter of aged altes—of altes</p>
    <p class=l>(old altes’ daughter, and lelegia’s heir;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who reigns over the warlike lelegae and holds steep pedasus on</p>
    <p class=l>who held in pedasus his famed abode,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the river satnioeis.</p>
    <p class=l>and ruled the fields where silver satnio flow’d,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam married his daughter along with many<br />other women and two sons were born of her, both of whom you will</p>
    <p class=l>two sons (alas!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have slain.</p>
    <p class=l>unhappy sons) she bore;<br />for ah!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your spear slew noble polydorus as he was fighting in</p>
    <p class=l>one spear shall drink each brother’s gore,<br />and i succeed to slaughter’d polydore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the front ranks, and now evil will here befall me, for i fear</p>
    <p class=l>how from that arm of terror shall i fly?<br />some demon urges!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that i shall not escape you since heaven has delivered me over to</p>
    <p class=l>’tis my doom to die!<br />if ever yet soft pity touch’d thy mind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you.</p>
    <p class=l>ah!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>furthermore i say, and lay my saying to your heart, spare</p>
    <p class=l>think not me too much of hector’s kind!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me, for i am not of the same womb as hector who slew your brave</p>
    <p class=l>not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and noble comrade.</p>
    <p class=l>with his, who wrought thy loved patroclus’ death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with such words did the princely son of priam beseech achilles;</p>
    <p class=l>these words, attended with a shower of tears,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but achilles answered him sternly.</p>
    <p class=l>the youth address’d to unrelenting ears:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“idiot,” said he, “talk not to</p>
    <p class=l>“talk not of life, or ransom (he replies):</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me of ransom.<br />until patroclus fell i preferred to give the<br />trojans quarter, and sold beyond the sea many of those whom i had<br />taken alive; but now not a man shall live of those whom heaven</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus dead, whoever meets me, dies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>delivers into my hands before the city of ilius—and of all</p>
    <p class=l>in vain a single trojan sues for grace;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans it shall fare hardest with the sons of priam.</p>
    <p class=l>but least, the sons of priam’s hateful race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore,<br />my friend, you too shall die.</p>
    <p class=l>die then, my friend!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>why should you whine in this way?</p>
    <p class=l>what boots it to deplore?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus fell, and he was a better man than you are.</p>
    <p class=l>the great, the good patroclus is no more!<br />he, far thy better, was foredoom’d to die,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i too—see</p>
    <p class=l>and thou, dost thou bewail mortality?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you not how i am great and goodly?<br />i am son to a noble father,</p>
    <p class=l>seest thou not me, whom nature’s gifts adorn,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and have a goddess for my mother, but the hands of doom and death</p>
    <p class=l>sprung from a hero, from a goddess born?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>overshadow me all as surely.<br />the day will come, either at dawn or</p>
    <p class=l>the day shall come (which nothing can avert)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dark, or at the noontide, when one shall take my life also in<br />battle, either with his spear, or with an arrow sped from his</p>
    <p class=l>when by the spear, the arrow, or the dart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bow.</p>
    <p class=l>by night, or day, by force, or by design,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>impending death and certain fate are mine!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he speak, and lycaon’s heart sank within him.</p>
    <p class=l>die then,”—he said; and as the word he spoke,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he loosed</p>
    <p class=l>the fainting stripling sank before the stroke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his hold of the spear, and held out both hands before him; but</p>
    <p class=l>his hand forgot its grasp, and left the spear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles drew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone</p>
    <p class=l>while all his trembling frame confess’d his fear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on his neck; he plunged his two-edged sword into him to the very</p>
    <p class=l>sudden, achilles his broad sword display’d,<br />and buried in his neck the reeking blade.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hilt, whereon he lay at full length on the ground, with the dark</p>
    <p class=l>prone fell the youth; and panting on the land,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>blood welling from him till the earth was soaked.</p>
    <p class=l>the gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then achilles</p>
    <p class=l>the victor to the stream the carcase gave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>caught him by the foot and flung him into the river to go down</p>
    <p class=l>and thus insults him, floating on the wave:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stream, vaunting over him the while, and saying, “lie there among</p>
    <p class=l>“lie there, lycaon!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fishes, who will lick the blood from your wound and gloat</p>
    <p class=l>let the fish surround<br />thy bloated corpse, and suck thy gory wound:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over it; your mother shall not lay you on any bier to mourn you,</p>
    <p class=l>there no sad mother shall thy funerals weep,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but the eddies of scamander shall bear you into the broad bosom</p>
    <p class=l>but swift scamander roll thee to the deep,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the sea.</p>
    <p class=l>whose every wave some watery monster brings,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there shall the fishes feed on the fat of lycaon as</p>
    <p class=l>to feast unpunish’d on the fat of kings.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they dart under the dark ripple of the waters—so perish all of<br />you till we reach the citadel of strong ilius—you in flight, and</p>
    <p class=l>so perish troy, and all the trojan line!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i following after to destroy you.</p>
    <p class=l>such ruin theirs, and such compassion mine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the river with its broad silver</p>
    <p class=l>what boots ye now scamander’s worshipp’d stream,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stream shall serve you in no stead, for all the bulls you offered</p>
    <p class=l>his earthly honours, and immortal name?<br />in vain your immolated bulls are slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him and all the horses that you flung living into his waters.</p>
    <p class=l>your living coursers glut his gulfs in vain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>none the less miserably shall you perish till there is not a man</p>
    <p class=l>thus he rewards you, with this bitter fate;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of you but has paid in full for the death of patroclus and the</p>
    <p class=l>thus, till the grecian vengeance is complete:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>havoc you wrought among the achaeans whom you have slain while i</p>
    <p class=l>thus is atoned patroclus’ honour’d shade,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>held aloof from battle.</p>
    <p class=l>and the short absence of achilles paid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so spoke achilles, but the river grew more and more angry, and</p>
    <p class=l>these boastful words provoked the raging god;<br />with fury swells the violated flood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pondered within himself how he should stay the hand of achilles</p>
    <p class=l>what means divine may yet the power employ</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and save the trojans from disaster.</p>
    <p class=l>to check achilles, and to rescue troy?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the son of peleus,</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile the hero springs in arms, to dare</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear in hand, sprang upon asteropaeus son of pelegon to kill</p>
    <p class=l>the great asteropeus to mortal war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him.</p>
    <p class=l>the son of pelagon, whose lofty line</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was son to the broad river axius and periboea eldest</p>
    <p class=l>flows from the source of axius, stream divine!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>daughter of acessamenus; for the river had lain with her.</p>
    <p class=l>(fair peribaea’s love the god had crown’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>asteropaeus stood up out of the water to face him with a spear in</p>
    <p class=l>with all his refluent waters circled round:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>either hand, and xanthus filled him with courage, being angry for</p>
    <p class=l>on him achilles rush’d; he fearless stood,<br />and shook two spears, advancing from the flood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the death of the youths whom achilles was slaying ruthlessly</p>
    <p class=l>the flood impell’d him, on pelides’ head</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>within his waters.</p>
    <p class=l>to avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they were close up with one another<br />achilles was first to speak.</p>
    <p class=l>near as they drew, achilles thus began:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“who and whence are you,” said he,</p>
    <p class=l>“what art thou, boldest of the race of man?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“who dare to face me?</p>
    <p class=l>who, or from whence?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>woe to the parents whose son stands up</p>
    <p class=l>unhappy is the sire<br />whose son encounters our resistless ire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against me.</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>” and the son of pelegon answered, “great son of</p>
    <p class=l>“o son of peleus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>peleus, why should you ask my lineage.</p>
    <p class=l>what avails to trace</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i am from the fertile land</p>
    <p class=l>(replied the warrior) our illustrious race?<br />from rich paeonia’s valleys i command,<br />arm’d with protended spears, my native band;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of far paeonia, captain of the paeonians, and it is now eleven<br />days that i am at ilius.</p>
    <p class=l>now shines the tenth bright morning since i came</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i am of the blood of the river axius—of</p>
    <p class=l>in aid of ilion to the fields of fame:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>axius that is the fairest of all rivers that run.</p>
    <p class=l>axius, who swells with all the neighbouring rills,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he begot the</p>
    <p class=l>and wide around the floated region fills,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>famed warrior pelegon, whose son men call me.</p>
    <p class=l>begot my sire, whose spear much glory won:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us now fight,</p>
    <p class=l>now lift thy arm, and try that hero’s son!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he defy him, and achilles raised his spear of pelian</p>
    <p class=l>threatening he said: the hostile chiefs advance;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ash.</p>
    <p class=l>at once asteropeus discharged each lance,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>asteropaeus failed with both his spears, for he could use<br />both hands alike; with the one spear he struck achilles’ shield,</p>
    <p class=l>(for both his dexterous hands the lance could wield,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but did not pierce it, for the layer of gold, gift of the god,<br />stayed the point; with the other spear he grazed the elbow of</p>
    <p class=l>one struck, but pierced not, the vulcanian shield;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles’ right arm drawing dark blood, but the spear itself went</p>
    <p class=l>one razed achilles’ hand; the spouting blood</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by him and fixed itself in the ground, foiled of its bloody</p>
    <p class=l>spun forth; in earth the fasten’d weapon stood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>banquet.</p>
    <p class=l>like lightning next the pelean javelin flies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then achilles, fain to kill him, hurled his spear at</p>
    <p class=l>its erring fury hiss’d along the skies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>asteropaeus, but failed to hit him and struck the steep bank of</p>
    <p class=l>deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the river, driving the spear half its length into the earth.</p>
    <p class=l>even to the middle earth; and quiver’d there.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>then from his side the sword pelides drew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of peleus then drew his sword and sprang furiously upon him.</p>
    <p class=l>and on his foe with double fury flew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>asteropaeus vainly tried to draw achilles’ spear out of the bank</p>
    <p class=l>the foe thrice tugg’d, and shook the rooted wood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by main force; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his might</p>
    <p class=l>repulsive of his might the weapon stood:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to draw it out, and thrice he had to leave off trying; the fourth<br />time he tried to bend and break it, but ere he could do so<br />achilles smote him with his sword and killed him.</p>
    <p class=l>the fourth, he tries to break the spear in vain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he struck him</p>
    <p class=l>bent as he stands, he tumbles to the plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the belly near the navel, so that all his bowels came gushing</p>
    <p class=l>his belly open’d with a ghastly wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>out on to the ground, and the darkness of death came over him as<br />he lay gasping.</p>
    <p class=l>the reeking entrails pour upon the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then achilles set his foot on his chest and</p>
    <p class=l>beneath the hero’s feet he panting lies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spoiled him of his armour, vaunting over him and saying, “lie</p>
    <p class=l>and his eye darkens, and his spirit flies;<br />while the proud victor thus triumphing said,<br />his radiant armour tearing from the dead:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there—begotten of a river though you be, it is hard for you to</p>
    <p class=l>“so ends thy glory!<br />such the fate they prove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strive with the offspring of saturn’s son.</p>
    <p class=l>who strive presumptuous with the sons of jove!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you declare yourself</p>
    <p class=l>sprung from a river, didst thou boast thy line?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sprung from the blood of a broad river, but i am of the seed of</p>
    <p class=l>but great saturnius is the source of mine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty jove.</p>
    <p class=l>how durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my father is peleus, son of aeacus ruler over the<br />many myrmidons, and aeacus was the son of jove.<br />therefore as jove</p>
    <p class=l>of peleus, æacus, and jove, am i.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is mightier than any river that flows into the sea, so are his</p>
    <p class=l>the race of these superior far to those,<br />as he that thunders to the stream that flows.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>children stronger than those of any river whatsoever.<br />moreover<br />you have a great river hard by if he can be of any use to you,</p>
    <p class=l>what rivers can, scamander might have shown;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but there is no fighting against jove the son of saturn, with</p>
    <p class=l>but jove he dreads, nor wars against his son.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whom not even king achelous can compare, nor the mighty stream of</p>
    <p class=l>even achelous might contend in vain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deep-flowing oceanus, from whom all rivers and seas with all</p>
    <p class=l>and all the roaring billows of the main.<br />the eternal ocean, from whose fountains flow</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>springs and deep wells proceed; even oceanus fears the lightnings</p>
    <p class=l>the seas, the rivers, and the springs below,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of great jove, and his thunder that comes crashing out of</p>
    <p class=l>the thundering voice of jove abhors to hear,<br />and in his deep abysses shakes with fear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heaven.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this he drew his bronze spear out of the bank, and now that</p>
    <p class=l>he said: then from the bank his javelin tore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he had killed asteropaeus, he let him lie where he was on the</p>
    <p class=l>and left the breathless warrior in his gore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sand, with the dark water flowing over him and the eels and</p>
    <p class=l>the floating tides the bloody carcase lave,<br />and beat against it, wave succeeding wave;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fishes busy nibbling and gnawing the fat that was about his</p>
    <p class=l>till, roll’d between the banks, it lies the food</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>kidneys.</p>
    <p class=l>of curling eels, and fishes of the flood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he went in chase of the paeonians, who were flying<br />along the bank of the river in panic when they saw their leader</p>
    <p class=l>all scatter’d round the stream (their mightiest slain)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>slain by the hands of the son of peleus.</p>
    <p class=l>the amazed pæonians scour along the plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therein he slew</p>
    <p class=l>he vents his fury on the flying crew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thersilochus, mydon, astypylus, mnesus, thrasius, oeneus, and</p>
    <p class=l>thrasius, astyplus, and mnesus slew;<br />mydon, thersilochus, with ænius, fell;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ophelestes, and he would have slain yet others, had not the river</p>
    <p class=l>and numbers more his lance had plunged to hell,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in anger taken human form, and spoken to him from out the deep</p>
    <p class=l>but from the bottom of his gulfs profound</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>waters saying, “achilles, if you excel all in strength, so do you</p>
    <p class=l>scamander spoke; the shores return’d the sound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>also in wickedness, for the gods are ever with you to protect</p>
    <p class=l>“o first of mortals!<br />(for the gods are thine)<br />in valour matchless, and in force divine!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you: if, then, the son of saturn has vouchsafed it to you to</p>
    <p class=l>if jove have given thee every trojan head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>destroy all the trojans, at any rate drive them out of my stream,</p>
    <p class=l>’tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and do your grim work on land.</p>
    <p class=l>see!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my fair waters are now filled with<br />corpses, nor can i find any channel by which i may pour myself</p>
    <p class=l>my choked streams no more their course can keep,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into the sea for i am choked with dead, and yet you go on</p>
    <p class=l>nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mercilessly slaying.</p>
    <p class=l>turn then, impetuous!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i am in despair, therefore, o captain of</p>
    <p class=l>from our injured flood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your host, trouble me no further.</p>
    <p class=l>content, thy slaughters could amaze a god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles answered, “so be it, scamander, jove-descended; but i</p>
    <p class=l>in human form, confess’d before his eyes,<br />the river thus; and thus the chief replies:<br />“o sacred stream!<br />thy word we shall obey;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will never cease dealing out death among the trojans, till i have</p>
    <p class=l>but not till troy the destined vengeance pay,<br />not till within her towers the perjured train</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pent them up in their city, and made trial of hector face to</p>
    <p class=l>shall pant, and tremble at our arms again;<br />not till proud hector, guardian of her wall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>face, that i may learn whether he is to vanquish me, or i him.</p>
    <p class=l>or stain this lance, or see achilles fall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he set upon the trojans with a fury like that of the</p>
    <p class=l>he said; and drove with fury on the foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gods.</p>
    <p class=l>then to the godhead of the silver bow</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but the river said to apollo, “surely, son of jove, lord of</p>
    <p class=l>the yellow flood began: “o son of jove!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the silver bow, you are not obeying the commands of jove who</p>
    <p class=l>was not the mandate of the sire above</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>charged you straitly that you should stand by the trojans and</p>
    <p class=l>full and express, that phœbus should employ</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>defend them, till twilight fades, and darkness is over the</p>
    <p class=l>his sacred arrows in defence of troy,<br />and make her conquer, till hyperion’s fall<br />in awful darkness hide the face of all?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>earth.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile achilles sprang from the bank into mid-stream, whereon</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke in vain—the chief without dismay</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the river raised a high wave and attacked him.</p>
    <p class=l>ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he swelled his</p>
    <p class=l>then rising in his rage above the shores,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stream into a torrent, and swept away the many dead whom achilles</p>
    <p class=l>from all his deep the bellowing river roars,<br />huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast,<br />and round the banks the ghastly dead are toss’d.<br />while all before, the billows ranged on high,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had slain and left within his waters.</p>
    <p class=l>(a watery bulwark,) screen the bands who fly.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these he cast out on to the</p>
    <p class=l>now bursting on his head with thundering sound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>land, bellowing like a bull the while, but the living he saved</p>
    <p class=l>the falling deluge whelms the hero round:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alive, hiding them in his mighty eddies.</p>
    <p class=l>his loaded shield bends to the rushing tide;<br />his feet, upborne, scarce the strong flood divide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the great and terrible</p>
    <p class=l>sliddering, and staggering.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wave gathered about achilles, falling upon him and beating on his</p>
    <p class=l>on the border stood<br />a spreading elm, that overhung the flood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shield, so that he could not keep his feet; he caught hold of a</p>
    <p class=l>he seized a bending bough, his steps to stay;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great elm-tree, but it came up by the roots, and tore away the</p>
    <p class=l>the plant uprooted to his weight gave way.<br />[270]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bank, damming the stream with its thick branches and bridging it</p>
    <p class=l>heaving the bank, and undermining all;<br />loud flash the waters to the rushing fall<br />of the thick foliage.<br />the large trunk display’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all across; whereby achilles struggled out of the stream, and</p>
    <p class=l>bridged the rough flood across: the hero stay’d<br />on this his weight, and raised upon his hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fled full speed over the plain, for he was afraid.</p>
    <p class=l>leap’d from the channel, and regain’d the land.<br />then blacken’d the wild waves: the murmur rose:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit, and sprang upon him</p>
    <p class=l>the god pursues, a huger billow throws,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with a dark-crested wave, to stay his hands and save the trojans<br />from destruction.</p>
    <p class=l>and bursts the bank, ambitious to destroy</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of peleus darted away a spear’s throw</p>
    <p class=l>the man whose fury is the fate of troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from him; swift as the swoop of a black hunter-eagle which is the</p>
    <p class=l>he like the warlike eagle speeds his pace</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strongest and fleetest of all birds, even so did he spring</p>
    <p class=l>(swiftest and strongest of the aerial race);<br />far as a spear can fly, achilles springs;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forward, and the armour rang loudly about his breast.</p>
    <p class=l>at every bound his clanging armour rings:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he fled on</p>
    <p class=l>now here, now there, he turns on every side,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in front, but the river with a loud roar came tearing after.</p>
    <p class=l>and winds his course before the following tide;<br />the waves flow after, wheresoe’er he wheels,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as</p>
    <p class=l>and gather fast, and murmur at his heels.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one who would water his garden leads a stream from some fountain</p>
    <p class=l>so when a peasant to his garden brings<br />soft rills of water from the bubbling springs,<br />and calls the floods from high, to bless his bowers,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over his plants, and all his ground—spade in hand he clears away</p>
    <p class=l>and feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers:<br />soon as he clears whate’er their passage stay’d,<br />and marks the future current with his spade,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the dams to free the channels, and the little stones run rolling</p>
    <p class=l>swift o’er the rolling pebbles, down the hills,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>round and round with the water as it goes merrily down the bank</p>
    <p class=l>louder and louder purl the falling rills;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>faster than the man can follow—even so did the river keep</p>
    <p class=l>before him scattering, they prevent his pains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>catching up with achilles albeit he was a fleet runner, for the</p>
    <p class=l>and shine in mazy wanderings o’er the plains.<br />still flies achilles, but before his eyes<br />still swift scamander rolls where’er he flies:<br />not all his speed escapes the rapid floods;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gods are stronger than men.</p>
    <p class=l>the first of men, but not a match for gods.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as often as he would strive to stand</p>
    <p class=l>oft as he turn’d the torrent to oppose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his ground, and see whether or no all the gods in heaven were in</p>
    <p class=l>and bravely try if all the powers were foes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>league against him, so often would the mighty wave come beating</p>
    <p class=l>so oft the surge, in watery mountains spread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>down upon his shoulders, and he would have to keep flying on and</p>
    <p class=l>beats on his back, or bursts upon his head.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on in great dismay; for the angry flood was tiring him out as it</p>
    <p class=l>yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves,<br />and still indignant bounds above the waves.<br />tired by the tides, his knees relax with toil;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flowed past him and ate the ground from under his feet.</p>
    <p class=l>wash’d from beneath him slides the slimy soil;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then the son of peleus lifted up his voice to heaven saying,</p>
    <p class=l>when thus (his eyes on heaven’s expansion thrown)<br />forth bursts the hero with an angry groan:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“father jove, is there none of the gods who will take pity upon</p>
    <p class=l>“is there no god achilles to befriend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me, and save me from the river?</p>
    <p class=l>no power to avert his miserable end?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i do not care what may happen to</p>
    <p class=l>prevent, o jove!<br />this ignominious date,[271]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me afterwards.</p>
    <p class=l>and make my future life the sport of fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i blame none of the other dwellers on olympus so</p>
    <p class=l>of all heaven’s oracles believed in vain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>severely as i do my dear mother, who has beguiled and tricked me.</p>
    <p class=l>but most of thetis must her son complain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she told me i was to fall under the walls of troy by the flying</p>
    <p class=l>by phœbus’ darts she prophesied my fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>arrows of apollo; would that hector, the best man among the</p>
    <p class=l>in glorious arms before the trojan wall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans, might there slay me; then should i fall a hero by the</p>
    <p class=l>oh!<br />had i died in fields of battle warm,<br />stretch’d like a hero, by a hero’s arm!<br />might hector’s spear this dauntless bosom rend,<br />and my swift soul o’ertake my slaughter’d friend.<br />ah no!<br />achilles meets a shameful fate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hand of a hero; whereas now it seems that i shall come to a most</p>
    <p class=l>oh how unworthy of the brave and great!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pitiable end, trapped in this river as though i were some</p>
    <p class=l>like some vile swain, whom on a rainy day,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>swineherd’s boy, who gets carried down a torrent while trying to</p>
    <p class=l>crossing a ford, the torrent sweeps away,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cross it during a storm.</p>
    <p class=l>an unregarded carcase to the sea.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as soon as he had spoken thus, neptune and minerva came up to him</p>
    <p class=l>neptune and pallas haste to his relief,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the likeness of two men, and took him by the hand to reassure<br />him.</p>
    <p class=l>and thus in human form address’d the chief:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neptune spoke first.</p>
    <p class=l>the power of ocean first: “forbear thy fear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“son of peleus,” said he, “be not so</p>
    <p class=l>o son of peleus!</p>

    <p class=r>exceeding fearful; we are two gods, come with jove’s sanction to</p>

    <p class=r>assist you, i, and pallas minerva.</p>
    <p class=l>behold!<br />from jove descending to thy aid,<br />propitious neptune, and the blue-eyed maid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it is not your fate to perish</p>
    <p class=l>stay, and the furious flood shall cease to rave<br />’tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in this river; he will abate presently as you will see; moreover</p>
    <p class=l>but thou, the counsel heaven suggests, attend!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we strongly advise you, if you will be guided by us, not to stay</p>
    <p class=l>nor breathe from combat, nor thy sword suspend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your hand from fighting till you have pent the trojan host within</p>
    <p class=l>till troy receive her flying sons, till all</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the famed walls of ilius—as many of them as may escape.</p>
    <p class=l>her routed squadrons pant behind their wall:</p>

    <p class=r>then kill</p>
    <p class=l>hector alone shall stand his fatal chance,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector and go back to the ships, for we will vouchsafe you a</p>
    <p class=l>and hector’s blood shall smoke upon thy lance.</p>

    <p class=r>triumph over him.</p>
    <p class=l>thine is the glory doom’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>” thus spake the gods:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they had so said they went back to the other immortals, but</p>
    <p class=l>then swift ascended to the bright abodes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles strove onward over the plain, encouraged by the charge</p>
    <p class=l>stung with new ardour, thus by heaven impell’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the gods had laid upon him.</p>
    <p class=l>he springs impetuous, and invades the field:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all was now covered with the flood of</p>
    <p class=l>o’er all the expanded plain the waters spread;<br />heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>waters, and much goodly armour of the youths that had been slain</p>
    <p class=l>floating ’midst scatter’d arms; while casques of gold</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was rifting about, as also many corpses, but he forced his way</p>
    <p class=l>and turn’d-up bucklers glitter’d as they roll’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against the stream, speeding right onwards, nor could the broad</p>
    <p class=l>high o’er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>waters stay him, for minerva had endowed him with great strength.</p>
    <p class=l>he wades, and mounts; the parted wave resounds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevertheless scamander did not slacken in his pursuit, but was</p>
    <p class=l>not a whole river stops the hero’s course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>still more furious with the son of peleus.</p>
    <p class=l>while pallas fills him with immortal force.<br />with equal rage, indignant xanthus roars,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he lifted his waters</p>
    <p class=l>and lifts his billows, and o’erwhelms his shores.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into a high crest and cried aloud to simois saying, “dear</p>
    <p class=l>then thus to simois!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brother, let the two of us unite to save this man, or he will</p>
    <p class=l>“haste, my brother flood;<br />and check this mortal that controls a god;</p>

    <p class=r>help me at once; fill your streams with water</p>
    <p class=l>call then thy subject streams, and bid them roar,</p>

    <p class=r>from their sources, rouse all your torrents to a fury; raise your</p>
    <p class=l>from all thy fountains swell thy watery store,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wave on high, and let snags and stones come thundering down you</p>
    <p class=l>with broken rocks, and with a load of dead,<br />charge the black surge, and pour it on his head.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that we may make an end of this savage creature who is now</p>
    <p class=l>mark how resistless through the floods he goes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lording it as though he were a god.</p>
    <p class=l>and boldly bids the warring gods be foes!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nothing shall serve him</p>
    <p class=l>but nor that force, nor form divine to sight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>longer, not strength nor comeliness, nor his fine armour, which</p>
    <p class=l>shall aught avail him, if our rage unite:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forsooth shall soon be lying low in the deep waters covered over</p>
    <p class=l>whelm’d under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with mud.</p>
    <p class=l>that blaze so dreadful in each trojan eye;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will wrap him in sand, and pour tons of shingle round</p>
    <p class=l>and deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him, so that the achaeans shall not know how to gather his bones</p>
    <p class=l>immersed remain this terror of the world.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the silt in which i shall have hidden him, and when they</p>
    <p class=l>such ponderous ruin shall confound the place,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>celebrate his funeral they need build no barrow.</p>
    <p class=l>no greeks shall e’er his perish’d relics grace,<br />no hand his bones shall gather, or inhume;<br />these his cold rites, and this his watery tomb.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this he upraised his tumultuous flood high against achilles,</p>
    <p class=l>[illustration: ] achilles contending with the rivers<br />he said; and on the chief descends amain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seething as it was with foam and blood and the bodies of the</p>
    <p class=l>increased with gore, and swelling with the slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dead.</p>
    <p class=l>then, murmuring from his beds, he boils, he raves,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the dark waters of the river stood upright and would have</p>
    <p class=l>and a foam whitens on the purple waves:<br />at every step, before achilles stood</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>overwhelmed the son of peleus, but juno, trembling lest achilles</p>
    <p class=l>the crimson surge, and deluged him with blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should be swept away in the mighty torrent, lifted her voice on</p>
    <p class=l>fear touch’d the queen of heaven: she saw dismay’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>high and called out to vulcan her son.</p>
    <p class=l>she call’d aloud, and summon’d vulcan’s aid.<br />“rise to the war!<br />the insulting flood requires</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“crook-foot,” she cried,</p>
    <p class=l>thy wasteful arm!</p>

    <p class=l>assemble all thy fires!</p>

    <p class=r>xanthus is fain to fight; help us at once, kindle a fierce fire;</p>
    <p class=l>while to their aid, by our command enjoin’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will then bring up the west and the white south wind in a</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty hurricane from the sea, that shall bear the flames against</p>

    <p class=r>the heads and armour of the trojans and consume them, while you</p>
    <p class=l>corses and arms to one bright ruin turn,</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this vulcan kindled a fierce fire, which broke out first upon</p>
    <p class=l>the power ignipotent her word obeys:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the plain and burned the many dead whom achilles had killed and<br />whose bodies were lying about in great numbers; by this means the</p>
    <p class=l>wide o’er the plain he pours the boundless blaze;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>plain was dried and the flood stayed.</p>
    <p class=l>at once consumes the dead, and dries the soil<br />and the shrunk waters in their channel boil.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as the north wind, blowing</p>
    <p class=l>as when autumnal boreas sweeps the sky,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on an orchard that has been sodden with autumn rain, soon dries</p>
    <p class=l>and instant blows the water’d gardens dry:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it, and the heart of the owner is glad—even so the whole plain<br />was dried and the dead bodies were consumed.<br />then he turned</p>
    <p class=l>so look’d the field, so whiten’d was the ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tongues of fire on to the river.</p>
    <p class=l>while vulcan breathed the fiery blast around.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he burned the elms the willows</p>
    <p class=l>swift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys;<br />along the margin winds the running blaze:<br />the trees in flaming rows to ashes turn,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and the tamarisks, the lotus also, with the rushes and marshy</p>
    <p class=l>the flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>herbage that grew abundantly by the banks of the river.</p>
    <p class=l>broad elm, and cypress rising in a spire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the eels</p>
    <p class=l>the watery willows hiss before the fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and fishes that go darting about everywhere in the water, these,</p>
    <p class=l>now glow the waves, the fishes pant for breath,<br />the eels lie twisting in the pangs of death:<br />now flounce aloft, now dive the scaly fry,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>too, were sorely harassed by the flames that cunning vulcan had</p>
    <p class=l>or, gasping, turn their bellies to the sky.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>kindled, and the river himself was scalded, so that he spoke</p>
    <p class=l>at length the river rear’d his languid head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saying, “vulcan, there is no god can hold his own against you.</p>
    <p class=l>and thus, short-panting, to the god he said:<br />“oh vulcan!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i</p>
    <p class=l>oh!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cannot fight you when you flare out your flames in this way;</p>
    <p class=l>what power resists thy might?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strive with me no longer.</p>
    <p class=l>i faint, i sink, unequal to the fight—</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let achilles drive the trojans out of<br />their city immediately.</p>
    <p class=l>i yield—let ilion fall; if fate decree—</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what have i to do with quarrelling and</p>
    <p class=l>ah—bend no more thy fiery arms on me!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>helping people?<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was boiling as he spoke, and all his waters were seething.</p>
    <p class=l>he ceased; wide conflagration blazing round;<br />the bubbling waters yield a hissing sound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as<br />a cauldron upon a large fire boils when it is melting the lard of</p>
    <p class=l>as when the flames beneath a cauldron rise,[272]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some fatted hog, and the lard keeps bubbling up all over when the</p>
    <p class=l>to melt the fat of some rich sacrifice,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dry faggots blaze under it—even so were the goodly waters of</p>
    <p class=l>amid the fierce embrace of circling fires<br />the waters foam, the heavy smoke aspires:<br />so boils the imprison’d flood, forbid to flow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>xanthus heated with the fire till they were boiling.</p>
    <p class=l>and choked with vapours feels his bottom glow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he could</p>
    <p class=l>to juno then, imperial queen of air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flow no longer but stayed his stream, so afflicted was he by the<br />blasts of fire which cunning vulcan had raised.<br />then he prayed to</p>
    <p class=l>the burning river sends his earnest prayer:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>juno and besought her saying, “juno, why should your son vex my</p>
    <p class=l>“ah why, saturnia; must thy son engage</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stream with such especial fury?<br />i am not so much to blame as all</p>
    <p class=l>me, only me, with all his wasteful rage?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the others are who have been helping the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>on other gods his dreadful arm employ,<br />for mightier gods assert the cause of troy.<br />submissive i desist, if thou command;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will leave</p>
    <p class=l>but ah!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>off, since you so desire it, and let your son leave off also.</p>
    <p class=l>withdraw this all-destroying hand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>furthermore i swear never again will i do anything to save the</p>
    <p class=l>hear then my solemn oath, to yield to fate</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans from destruction, not even when all troy is burning in</p>
    <p class=l>unaided ilion, and her destined state,<br />till greece shall gird her with destructive flame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the flames which the achaeans will kindle.</p>
    <p class=l>and in one ruin sink the trojan name.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as soon as juno heard this she said to her son vulcan, “son</p>
    <p class=l>his warm entreaty touch’d saturnia’s ear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vulcan, hold now your flames; we ought not to use such violence</p>
    <p class=l>she bade the ignipotent his rage forbear,<br />recall the flame, nor in a mortal cause</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against a god for the sake of mortals.<br />”<br />when she had thus spoken vulcan quenched his flames, and the</p>
    <p class=l>infest a god: the obedient flame withdraws:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>river went back once more into his own fair bed.</p>
    <p class=l>again the branching streams begin to spread,<br />and soft remurmur in their wonted bed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>xanthus was now beaten, so these two left off fighting, for juno<br />stayed them though she was still angry; but a furious quarrel</p>
    <p class=l>while these by juno’s will the strife resign,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>broke out among the other gods, for they were of divided<br />counsels.</p>
    <p class=l>the warring gods in fierce contention join:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they fell on one another with a mighty uproar—earth</p>
    <p class=l>rekindling rage each heavenly breast alarms:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>groaned, and the spacious firmament rang out as with a blare of</p>
    <p class=l>with horrid clangour shock the ethereal arms:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trumpets.</p>
    <p class=l>heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound;<br />and wide beneath them groans the rending ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove heard as he was sitting on olympus, and laughed</p>
    <p class=l>jove, as his sport, the dreadful scene descries,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for joy when he saw the gods coming to blows among themselves.</p>
    <p class=l>and views contending gods with careless eyes.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were not long about beginning, and mars piercer of shields<br />opened the battle.<br />sword in hand he sprang at once upon minerva</p>
    <p class=l>the power of battles lifts his brazen spear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and reviled her.</p>
    <p class=l>and first assaults the radiant queen of war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“why, vixen,” said he, “have you again set the</p>
    <p class=l>“what moved thy madness, thus to disunite</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gods by the ears in the pride and haughtiness of your heart?</p>
    <p class=l>ethereal minds, and mix all heaven in fight?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have</p>
    <p class=l>what wonder this, when in thy frantic mood</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you forgotten how you set diomed son of tydeus on to wound me,</p>
    <p class=l>thou drovest a mortal to insult a god?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and yourself took visible spear and drove it into me to the hurt</p>
    <p class=l>thy impious hand tydides’ javelin bore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of my fair body?<br />you shall now suffer for what you then did to</p>
    <p class=l>and madly bathed it in celestial gore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he struck her on the terrible tasselled aegis—so</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, and smote the long-resounding shield,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>terrible that not even can jove’s lightning pierce it.</p>
    <p class=l>which bears jove’s thunder on its dreadful field:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>here did</p>
    <p class=l>the adamantine ægis of her sire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>murderous mars strike her with his great spear.</p>
    <p class=l>that turns the glancing bolt and forked fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she drew back and</p>
    <p class=l>then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with her strong hand seized a stone that was lying on the</p>
    <p class=l>a stone, the limit of the neighbouring land,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>plain—great and rugged and black—which men of old had set for the</p>
    <p class=l>there fix’d from eldest times; black, craggy, vast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>boundary of a field.<br />with this she struck mars on the neck, and</p>
    <p class=l>this at the heavenly homicide she cast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brought him down.</p>
    <p class=l>thundering he falls, a mass of monstrous size:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nine roods did he cover in his fall, and his</p>
    <p class=l>and seven broad acres covers as he lies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hair was all soiled in the dust, while his armour rang rattling</p>
    <p class=l>the stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>round him.</p>
    <p class=l>loud o’er the fields his ringing arms resound:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but minerva laughed and vaunted over him saying,</p>
    <p class=l>the scornful dame her conquest views with smiles,<br />and, glorying, thus the prostrate god reviles:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“idiot, have you not learned how far stronger i am than you, but<br />you must still match yourself against me?</p>
    <p class=l>“hast thou not yet, insatiate fury!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus do your mother’s</p>
    <p class=l>known</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>curses now roost upon you, for she is angry and would do you</p>
    <p class=l>how far minerva’s force transcends thy own?<br />juno, whom thou rebellious darest withstand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mischief because you have deserted the achaeans and are helping</p>
    <p class=l>corrects thy folly thus by pallas’ hand;<br />thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>and partial aid to troy’s perfidious race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she then turned her two piercing eyes elsewhere, whereon jove’s</p>
    <p class=l>the goddess spoke, and turn’d her eyes away,<br />that, beaming round, diffused celestial day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>daughter venus took mars by the hand and led him away groaning</p>
    <p class=l>jove’s cyprian daughter, stooping on the land,<br />lent to the wounded god her tender hand:<br />slowly he rises, scarcely breathes with pain,<br />and, propp’d on her fair arm, forsakes the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all the time, for it was only with great difficulty that he had</p>
    <p class=l>this the bright empress of the heavens survey’d,<br />and, scoffing, thus to war’s victorious maid:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come to himself again.</p>
    <p class=l>“lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when queen juno saw her, she said to</p>
    <p class=l>what an aid on mars’s side is seen!<br />the smiles’ and loves’ unconquerable queen!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva, “look, daughter of aegis-bearing jove, unweariable, that<br />vixen venus is again taking mars through the crowd out of the</p>
    <p class=l>mark with what insolence, in open view,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battle; go after her at once.</p>
    <p class=l>she moves: let pallas, if she dares, pursue.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”<br />thus she spoke.</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva sped after venus with a will, and made at</p>
    <p class=l>minerva smiling heard, the pair o’ertook,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her, striking her on the bosom with her strong hand so that she</p>
    <p class=l>and slightly on her breast the wanton strook:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fell fainting to the ground, and there they both lay stretched at</p>
    <p class=l>she, unresisting, fell (her spirits fled);</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>full length.</p>
    <p class=l>on earth together lay the lovers spread.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then minerva vaunted over her saying, “may all who</p>
    <p class=l>“and like these heroes be the fate of all</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>help the trojans against the argives prove just as redoubtable</p>
    <p class=l>(minerva cries) who guard the trojan wall!<br />to grecian gods such let the phrygian be,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and stalwart as venus did when she came across me while she was<br />helping mars.<br />had this been so, we should long since have ended</p>
    <p class=l>so dread, so fierce, as venus is to me;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the war by sacking the strong city of ilius.</p>
    <p class=l>then from the lowest stone shall troy be moved.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>juno smiled as she listened.</p>
    <p class=l>thus she, and juno with a smile approved.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile king neptune turned to</p>
    <p class=l>meantime, to mix in more than mortal fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo saying, “phoebus, why should we keep each other at arm’s</p>
    <p class=l>the god of ocean dares the god of light.</p>

    <p class=l>we shared the lengthen’d labours of a year?</p>

    <p class=r>i built the trojans the wall</p>
    <p class=l>troy walls i raised (for such were jove’s commands),</p>

    <p class=r>sent us off with nothing but abuse.</p>

    <p class=r>moreover, to cut off the ears of both of us, so we went away in a</p>

    <p class=r>brother of his own father.</p>

    <p class=l>him thus retreating, artemis upbraids,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroness of wild beasts, was very angry with him and said, “so</p>
    <p class=l>the quiver’d huntress of the sylvan shades:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you would fly, far-darter, and hand victory over to neptune with</p>

    <p class=l>now boast no more in yon celestial bower,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>up and fight with neptune.</p>
    <p class=l>thy force can match the great earth-shaking power.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo made her no answer, but jove’s august queen was angry and</p>
    <p class=l>silent he heard the queen of woods upbraid:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upbraided her bitterly.</p>
    <p class=l>not so saturnia bore the vaunting maid:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“bold vixen,” she cried, “how dare you</p>
    <p class=l>but furious thus: “what insolence has driven</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cross me thus?<br />for all your bow you will find it hard to hold<br />your own against me.</p>

    <p class=r>you will find it better</p>
    <p class=l>thy sex’s tyrant, with a tiger’s heart?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to chase wild beasts and deer upon the mountains than to fight</p>
    <p class=l>what though tremendous in the woodland chase</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>those who are stronger than you are.</p>
    <p class=l>thy certain arrows pierce the savage race?</p>

    <p class=r>if you would try war, do so,</p>
    <p class=l>how dares thy rashness on the powers divine</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and find out by pitting yourself against me, how far stronger i<br />am than you are.</p>
    <p class=l>employ those arms, or match thy force with mine?</p>

    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>learn hence, no more unequal war to wage—”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she caught both diana’s wrists with her left hand as she spoke,</p>
    <p class=l>she said, and seized her wrists with eager rage;<br />these in her left hand lock’d, her right untied</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and with her right she took the bow from her shoulders, and</p>
    <p class=l>the bow, the quiver, and its plumy pride.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>laughed as she beat her with it about the ears while diana</p>
    <p class=l>about her temples flies the busy bow;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wriggled and writhed under her blows.</p>
    <p class=l>now here, now there, she winds her from the blow;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her swift arrows were shed</p>
    <p class=l>the scattering arrows, rattling from the case,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon the ground, and she fled weeping from under juno’s hand as a</p>
    <p class=l>drop round, and idly mark the dusty place.<br />swift from the field the baffled huntress flies,<br />and scarce restrains the torrent in her eyes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dove that flies before a falcon to the cleft of some hollow rock,</p>
    <p class=l>so, when the falcon wings her way above,<br />to the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when it is her good fortune to escape.</p>
    <p class=l>(not fated yet to die;) there safe retreats,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so did she fly</p>
    <p class=l>yet still her heart against the marble beats.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>weeping away, leaving her bow and arrows behind her.</p>
    <p class=l>to her latona hastes with tender care;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then the slayer of argus, guide and guardian, said to leto,</p>
    <p class=l>whom hermes viewing, thus declines the war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“leto, i shall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows with any</p>
    <p class=l>“how shall i face the dame, who gives delight<br />to him whose thunders blacken heaven with night?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of jove’s wives.</p>
    <p class=l>go, matchless goddess!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore boast as you will among the immortals</p>
    <p class=l>triumph in the skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that you worsted me in fair fight.</p>
    <p class=l>and boast my conquest, while i yield the prize.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>leto then gathered up diana’s bow and arrows that had fallen</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke; and pass’d: latona, stooping low,<br />collects the scatter’d shafts and fallen bow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about amid the whirling dust, and when she had got them she made</p>
    <p class=l>that, glittering on the dust, lay here and there</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all haste after her daughter.</p>
    <p class=l>dishonour’d relics of diana’s war:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diana had now reached jove’s</p>
    <p class=l>then swift pursued her to her blest abode,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bronze-floored mansion on olympus, and sat herself down with many</p>
    <p class=l>where, all confused, she sought the sovereign god;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tears on the knees of her father, while her ambrosial raiment was</p>
    <p class=l>weeping, she grasp’d his knees: the ambrosial vest</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quivering all about her.</p>
    <p class=l>shook with her sighs, and panted on her breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of saturn drew her towards him,<br />and laughing pleasantly the while began to question her saying,</p>
    <p class=l>the sire superior smiled, and bade her show</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“which of the heavenly beings, my dear child, has been treating<br />you in this cruel manner, as though you had been misconducting</p>
    <p class=l>what heavenly hand had caused his daughter’s woe?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yourself in the face of everybody?<br />” and the fair-crowned goddess<br />of the chase answered, “it was your wife juno, father, who has<br />been beating me; it is always her doing when there is any</p>
    <p class=l>abash’d, she names his own imperial spouse;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quarrelling among the immortals.</p>
    <p class=l>and the pale crescent fades upon her brows.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”<br />thus did they converse, and meanwhile phoebus apollo entered the</p>
    <p class=l>thus they above: while, swiftly gliding down,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strong city of ilius, for he was uneasy lest the wall should not</p>
    <p class=l>apollo enters ilion’s sacred town;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hold out and the danaans should take the city then and there,</p>
    <p class=l>the guardian-god now trembled for her wall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>before its hour had come; but the rest of the ever-living gods</p>
    <p class=l>and fear’d the greeks, though fate forbade her fall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went back, some angry and some triumphant to olympus, where they</p>
    <p class=l>back to olympus, from the war’s alarms,<br />return the shining bands of gods in arms;<br />some proud in triumph, some with rage on fire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>took their seats beside jove lord of the storm-cloud, while</p>
    <p class=l>and take their thrones around the ethereal sire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles still kept on dealing out death alike on the trojans and</p>
    <p class=l>through blood, through death, achilles still proceeds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on their horses.</p>
    <p class=l>o’er slaughter’d heroes, and o’er rolling steeds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when the smoke from some burning city ascends</p>
    <p class=l>as when avenging flames with fury driven</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to heaven when the anger of the gods has kindled it—there is then</p>
    <p class=l>on guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>toil for all, and sorrow for not a few—even so did achilles bring</p>
    <p class=l>the pale inhabitants, some fall, some fly;<br />and the red vapours purple all the sky:<br />so raged achilles: death and dire dismay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>toil and sorrow on the trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>and toils, and terrors, fill’d the dreadful day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>old king priam stood on a high tower of the wall looking down on</p>
    <p class=l>high on a turret hoary priam stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>huge achilles as the trojans fled panic-stricken before him, and</p>
    <p class=l>and marks the waste of his destructive hands;<br />views, from his arm, the trojans’ scatter’d flight,<br />and the near hero rising on his sight!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there was none to help them.</p>
    <p class=l>no stop, no check, no aid!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>presently he came down from off the</p>
    <p class=l>with feeble pace,<br />and settled sorrow on his aged face,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tower and with many a groan went along the wall to give orders to</p>
    <p class=l>fast as he could, he sighing quits the walls;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the brave warders of the gate.</p>
    <p class=l>and thus descending, on the guards he calls:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“keep the gates,” said he, “wide</p>
    <p class=l>“you to whose care our city-gates belong,<br />set wide your portals to the flying throng:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>open till the people come flying into the city, for achilles is</p>
    <p class=l>for lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hard by and is driving them in rout before him.</p>
    <p class=l>he comes, with unresisted sway;<br />he comes, and desolation marks his way!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i see we are in<br />great peril.<br />as soon as our people are inside and in safety,</p>
    <p class=l>but when within the walls our troops take breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>close the strong gates for i fear lest that terrible man should<br />come bounding inside along with the others.</p>
    <p class=l>lock fast the brazen bars, and shut out death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened the gates, and</p>
    <p class=l>thus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flung<br />the opening folds; the sounding hinges rung.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when these were opened there was a haven of refuge for the</p>
    <p class=l>phœbus rush’d forth, the flying bands to meet;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>struck slaughter back, and cover’d the retreat,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo then came full speed out of the city to meet them</p>
    <p class=l>on heaps the trojans crowd to gain the gate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and protect them.</p>
    <p class=l>and gladsome see their last escape from fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>right for the city and the high wall, parched</p>
    <p class=l>thither, all parch’d with thirst, a heartless train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with thirst and grimy with dust, still they fled on, with</p>
    <p class=l>hoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain:<br />and gasping, panting, fainting, labour on</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles wielding his spear furiously behind them.</p>
    <p class=l>with heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.<br />enraged achilles follows with his spear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for he was as</p>
    <p class=l>wild with revenge, insatiable of war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one possessed, and was thirsting after glory.</p>
    <p class=l>then had the greeks eternal praise acquired,<br />and troy inglorious to her walls retired;<br />but he, the god who darts ethereal flame,<br />shot down to save her, and redeem her fame:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then had the sons of the achaeans taken the lofty gates of troy</p>
    <p class=l>to young agenor force divine he gave;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if apollo had not spurred on agenor, valiant and noble son to<br />antenor.</p>
    <p class=l>(antenor’s offspring, haughty, bold, and brave;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he put courage into his heart, and stood by his side to<br />guard him, leaning against a beech tree and shrouded in thick</p>
    <p class=l>in aid of him, beside the beech he sate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>darkness.</p>
    <p class=l>and wrapt in clouds, restrain’d the hand of fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when agenor saw achilles he stood still and his heart</p>
    <p class=l>when now the generous youth achilles spies,<br />thick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was clouded with care.</p>
    <p class=l>(so, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.<br />)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“alas,” said he to himself in his dismay,</p>
    <p class=l>he stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“if i fly before mighty achilles, and go where all the others are</p>
    <p class=l>“what, shall i fly this terror of the plain!<br />like others fly, and be like others slain?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>being driven in rout, he will none the less catch me and kill me</p>
    <p class=l>vain hope!<br />to shun him by the self-same road</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for a coward.</p>
    <p class=l>yon line of slaughter’d trojans lately trod.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>how would it be were i to let achilles drive the</p>
    <p class=l>no: with the common heap i scorn to fall—</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>others before him, and then fly from the wall to the plain that</p>
    <p class=l>what if they pass’d me to the trojan wall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is behind ilius till i reach the spurs of ida and can hide in the</p>
    <p class=l>while i decline to yonder path, that leads</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>underwood that is thereon?</p>
    <p class=l>to ida’s forests and surrounding shades?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i could then wash the sweat from off</p>
    <p class=l>so may i reach, conceal’d, the cooling flood,<br />from my tired body wash the dirt and blood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me in the river and in the evening return to ilius.</p>
    <p class=l>as soon as night her dusky veil extends,<br />return in safety to my trojan friends.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but why</p>
    <p class=l>what if?<br />—but wherefore all this vain debate?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>commune with myself in this way?</p>
    <p class=l>stand i to doubt, within the reach of fate?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like enough he would see me as i</p>
    <p class=l>even now perhaps, ere yet i turn the wall,<br />the fierce achilles sees me, and i fall:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>am hurrying from the city over the plain, and would speed after</p>
    <p class=l>such is his swiftness, ’tis in vain to fly,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me till he had caught me—i should stand no chance against him,<br />for he is mightiest of all mankind.</p>
    <p class=l>and such his valour, that who stands must die.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what, then, if i go out and</p>
    <p class=l>howe’er ’tis better, fighting for the state,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meet him in front of the city?</p>
    <p class=l>here, and in public view, to meet my fate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his flesh too, i take it, can be</p>
    <p class=l>yet sure he too is mortal; he may feel</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pierced by pointed bronze.</p>
    <p class=l>(like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>life is the same in one and all, and<br />men say that he is but mortal despite the triumph that jove son</p>
    <p class=l>one only soul informs that dreadful frame:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of saturn vouchsafes him.</p>
    <p class=l>and jove’s sole favour gives him all his fame.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so saying he stood on his guard and awaited achilles, for he was</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and stood, collected, in his might;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now fain to fight him.</p>
    <p class=l>and all his beating bosom claim’d the fight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as a leopardess that bounds from out a</p>
    <p class=l>so from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thick covert to attack a hunter—she knows no fear and is not</p>
    <p class=l>roused from his thicket by a storm of darts:<br />untaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dismayed by the baying of the hounds; even though the man be too</p>
    <p class=l>of shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quick for her and wound her either with thrust or spear, still,</p>
    <p class=l>though struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>though the spear has pierced her she will not give in till she</p>
    <p class=l>and the barb’d javelin stings his breast in vain:<br />on their whole war, untamed, the savage flies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>has either caught him in her grip or been killed outright—even so</p>
    <p class=l>and tears his hunter, or beneath him dies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did noble agenor son of antenor refuse to fly till he had made</p>
    <p class=l>not less resolved, antenor’s valiant heir</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trial of achilles, and took aim at him with his spear, holding</p>
    <p class=l>confronts achilles, and awaits the war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his round shield before him and crying with a loud voice.</p>
    <p class=l>disdainful of retreat: high held before,<br />his shield (a broad circumference) he bore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“of a</p>
    <p class=l>then graceful as he stood, in act to throw</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>truth,” said he, “noble achilles, you deem that you shall this</p>

    <p class=r>day sack the city of the proud trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>“how proud achilles glories in his fame!<br />and hopes this day to sink the trojan name</p>

    <p class=r>fool, there will be</p>
    <p class=l>beneath her ruins!<br />know, that hope is vain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trouble enough yet before it, for there is many a brave man of us</p>
    <p class=l>a thousand woes, a thousand toils remain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>still inside who will stand in front of our dear parents with our</p>
    <p class=l>parents and children our just arms employ,</p>

    <p class=r>wives and children, to defend ilius.</p>
    <p class=l>and strong and many are the sons of troy.</p>

    <p class=r>mighty warrior though you be, here shall you die.</p>
    <p class=l>these phrygian fields, and press a foreign shore.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin from him, and the</p>
    <p class=l>he said: with matchless force the javelin flung</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear struck achilles on the leg beneath the knee; the greave of</p>
    <p class=l>smote on his knee; the hollow cuishes rung</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>newly wrought tin rang loudly, but the spear recoiled from the<br />body of him whom it had struck, and did not pierce it, for the</p>
    <p class=l>beneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>god’s gift stayed it.</p>
    <p class=l>he stands impassive in the ethereal arms.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles in his turn attacked noble agenor,</p>
    <p class=l>then fiercely rushing on the daring foe,<br />his lifted arm prepares the fatal blow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but apollo would not vouchsafe him glory, for he snatched agenor</p>
    <p class=l>but, jealous of his fame, apollo shrouds<br />the god-like trojan in a veil of clouds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>away and hid him in a thick mist, sending him out of the battle</p>
    <p class=l>safe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>unmolested.</p>
    <p class=l>dismiss’d with fame, the favoured youth withdrew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he craftily drew the son of peleus away from</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile the god, to cover their escape,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>going after the host, for he put on the semblance of agenor and</p>
    <p class=l>assumes agenor’s habit, voice and shape,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stood in front of achilles, who ran towards him to give him chase</p>
    <p class=l>flies from the furious chief in this disguise;<br />the furious chief still follows where he flies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and pursued him over the corn lands of the plain, turning him</p>
    <p class=l>now o’er the fields they stretch with lengthen’d strides,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>towards the deep waters of the river scamander.</p>
    <p class=l>now urge the course where swift scamander glides:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo ran but a</p>
    <p class=l>the god, now distant scarce a stride before,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>little way before him and beguiled achilles by making him think</p>
    <p class=l>tempts his pursuit, and wheels about the shore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all the time that he was on the point of overtaking him.</p>
    <p class=l>while all the flying troops their speed employ,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the rabble of routed trojans was thankful to crowd</p>
    <p class=l>and pour on heaps into the walls of troy:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>within the city till their numbers thronged it; no longer did<br />they dare wait for one another outside the city walls, to learn</p>
    <p class=l>no stop, no stay; no thought to ask, or tell,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who had escaped and who were fallen in fight, but all whose feet</p>
    <p class=l>who ’scaped by flight, or who by battle fell.<br />’twas tumult all, and violence of flight;<br />and sudden joy confused, and mix’d affright.<br />pale troy against achilles shuts her gate:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and knees could still carry them poured pell-mell into the town.</p>
    <p class=l>and nations breathe, deliver’d from their fate.</p>

    <p class=r>the death of hector.</p>
    <p class=l>argument.<br />the death of hector.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus the trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweat</p>
    <p class=l>the trojans being safe within the walls, hector only stays to oppose</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from off them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against</p>
    <p class=l>achilles.<br />priam is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his<br />son to re-enter the town.<br />hecuba joins her entreaties, but in vain.<br />hector consults within himself what measures to take; but at the<br />advance of achilles, his resolution fails him, and he flies.<br />achilles<br />pursues him thrice round the walls of troy.<br />the gods debate concerning<br />the fate of hector; at length minerva descends to the aid of achilles.<br />she deludes hector in the shape of deiphobus; he stands the combat, and<br />is slain.<br />achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of<br />priam and hecuba.<br />their lamentations, tears, and despair.<br />their cries<br />reach the ears of andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired into<br />the inner part of the palace: she mounts up to the walls, and beholds<br />her dead husband.<br />she swoons at the spectacle.<br />her excess of grief and<br />lamentation.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the goodly battlements, while the achaeans with their shields</p>
    <p class=l>the thirtieth day still continues.<br />the scene lies under the walls,<br />and on the battlements of troy.<br />thus to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear,<br />the herded ilians rush like driven deer:<br />there safe they wipe the briny drops away,<br />and drown in bowls the labours of the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>laid upon their shoulders drew close up to the walls.</p>
    <p class=l>close to the walls, advancing o’er the fields</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but stern</p>
    <p class=l>beneath one roof of well-compacted shields,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fate bade hector stay where he was before ilius and the scaean</p>
    <p class=l>march, bending on, the greeks’ embodied powers,<br />far stretching in the shade of trojan towers.<br />great hector singly stay’d: chain’d down by fate<br />there fix’d he stood before the scæan gate;<br />still his bold arms determined to employ,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gates.</p>
    <p class=l>the guardian still of long-defended troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then phoebus apollo spoke to the son of peleus saying,</p>
    <p class=l>apollo now to tired achilles turns:<br />(the power confess’d in all his glory burns:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“why, son of peleus, do you, who are but man, give chase to me</p>
    <p class=l>“and what (he cries) has peleus’ son in view,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who am immortal?</p>
    <p class=l>with mortal speed a godhead to pursue?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have you not yet found out that it is a god whom</p>
    <p class=l>for not to thee to know the gods is given,<br />unskill’d to trace the latent marks of heaven.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you pursue so furiously?</p>
    <p class=l>what boots thee now, that troy forsook the plain?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you did not harass the trojans whom you</p>
    <p class=l>vain thy past labour, and thy present vain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had routed, and now they are within their walls, while you have<br />been decoyed hither away from them.</p>
    <p class=l>safe in their walls are now her troops bestow’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me you cannot kill, for death</p>
    <p class=l>while here thy frantic rage attacks a god.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can take no hold upon me.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles was greatly angered and said, “you have baulked me,</p>
    <p class=l>the chief incensed—“too partial god of day!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>far-darter, most malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away</p>
    <p class=l>to check my conquests in the middle way:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from the wall, where many another man would have bitten the dust</p>
    <p class=l>how few in ilion else had refuge found!<br />what gasping numbers now had bit the ground!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ere he got within ilius; you have robbed me of great glory and</p>
    <p class=l>thou robb’st me of a glory justly mine,<br />powerful of godhead, and of fraud divine:<br />mean fame, alas!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have saved the trojans at no risk to yourself, for you have</p>
    <p class=l>for one of heavenly strain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nothing to fear, but i would indeed have my revenge if it were in</p>
    <p class=l>to cheat a mortal who repines in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my power to do so.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as the</p>
    <p class=l>then to the city, terrible and strong,<br />with high and haughty steps he tower’d along,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>winning horse in a chariot race strains every nerve when he is</p>
    <p class=l>so the proud courser, victor of the prize,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flying over the plain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs</p>
    <p class=l>to the near goal with double ardour flies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of achilles bear him onwards.</p>
    <p class=l>him, as he blazing shot across the field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>king priam was first to note him as</p>
    <p class=l>the careful eyes of priam first beheld.<br />not half so dreadful rises to the sight,[274]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he scoured the plain, all radiant as the star which men call</p>
    <p class=l>through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>orion’s hound, and whose beams blaze forth in time of harvest</p>
    <p class=l>orion’s dog (the year when autumn weighs),</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>more brilliantly than those of any other that shines by night;</p>
    <p class=l>and o’er the feebler stars exerts his rays;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brightest of them all though he be, he yet bodes ill for mortals,</p>
    <p class=l>terrific glory!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for he brings fire and fever in his train—even so did achilles’</p>
    <p class=l>for his burning breath<br />taints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>armour gleam on his breast as he sped onwards.</p>
    <p class=l>so flamed his fiery mail.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam raised a cry</p>
    <p class=l>then wept the sage:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and beat his head with his hands as he lifted them up and shouted</p>
    <p class=l>he strikes his reverend head, now white with age;<br />he lifts his wither’d arms; obtests the skies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>out to his dear son, imploring him to return; but hector still</p>
    <p class=l>he calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:<br />the son, resolved achilles’ force to dare,</p>

    <p class=r>stayed before the gates, for his heart was set upon doing battle</p>
    <p class=l>full at the scæan gates expects the war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>while the sad father on the rampart stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the old man reached out his arms towards him and</p>
    <p class=l>and thus adjures him with extended hands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bade him for pity’s sake come within the walls.</p>
    <p class=l>“ah stay not, stay not!</p>

    <p class=r>“hector,” he</p>
    <p class=l>guardless and alone;<br />hector!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cried, “my son, stay not to face this man alone and unsupported,</p>
    <p class=l>my loved, my dearest, bravest son!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or you will meet death at the hands of the son of peleus, for he</p>
    <p class=l>methinks already i behold thee slain,<br />and stretch’d beneath that fury of the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is mightier than you.</p>
    <p class=l>implacable achilles!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>monster that he is; would indeed that the</p>
    <p class=l>might’st thou be</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gods loved him no better than i do, for so, dogs and vultures</p>
    <p class=l>to all the gods no dearer than to me!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would soon devour him as he lay stretched on earth, and a load of</p>
    <p class=l>thee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore,<br />and bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>grief would be lifted from my heart, for many a brave son has he</p>
    <p class=l>how many valiant sons i late enjoy’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>reft from me, either by killing them or selling them away in the</p>
    <p class=l>valiant in vain!<br />by thy cursed arm destroy’d:<br />or, worse than slaughtered, sold in distant isles</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>islands that are beyond the sea: even now i miss two sons from</p>
    <p class=l>to shameful bondage, and unworthy toils.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among the trojans who have thronged within the city, lycaon and</p>
    <p class=l>two, while i speak, my eyes in vain explore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>polydorus, whom laothoe peeress among women bore me.</p>
    <p class=l>two from one mother sprung, my polydore,<br />and loved lycaon; now perhaps no more!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should they</p>
    <p class=l>oh!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be still alive and in the hands of the achaeans, we will ransom</p>
    <p class=l>if in yonder hostile camp they live,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them with gold and bronze, of which we have store, for the old</p>
    <p class=l>what heaps of gold, what treasures would i give!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>man altes endowed his daughter richly; but if they are already</p>
    <p class=l>(their grandsire’s wealth, by right of birth their own,<br />consign’d his daughter with lelegia’s throne:)<br />but if (which heaven forbid) already lost,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dead and in the house of hades, sorrow will it be to us two who</p>
    <p class=l>all pale they wander on the stygian coast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were their parents; albeit the grief of others will be more</p>
    <p class=l>what sorrows then must their sad mother know,<br />what anguish i?<br />unutterable woe!<br />yet less that anguish, less to her, to me,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>short-lived unless you too perish at the hands of achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>less to all troy, if not deprived of thee.<br />yet shun achilles!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come,</p>
    <p class=l>enter yet the wall;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then, my son, within the city, to be the guardian of trojan men</p>
    <p class=l>and spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and trojan women, or you will both lose your own life and afford</p>
    <p class=l>save thy dear life; or, if a soul so brave</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a mighty triumph to the son of peleus.</p>
    <p class=l>neglect that thought, thy dearer glory save.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have pity also on your</p>
    <p class=l>pity, while yet i live, these silver hairs;<br />while yet thy father feels the woes he bears,<br />yet cursed with sense!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>unhappy father while life yet remains to him—on me, whom the son</p>
    <p class=l>a wretch, whom in his rage</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of saturn will destroy by a terrible doom on the threshold of old</p>
    <p class=l>(all trembling on the verge of helpless age)<br />great jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!<br />the bitter dregs of fortune’s cup to drain:<br />to fill with scenes of death his closing eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>age, after i have seen my sons slain and my daughters haled away</p>
    <p class=l>and number all his days by miseries!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as captives, my bridal chambers pillaged, little children dashed</p>
    <p class=l>my heroes slain, my bridal bed o’erturn’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to earth amid the rage of battle, and my sons’ wives dragged away</p>
    <p class=l>my daughters ravish’d, and my city burn’d,<br />my bleeding infants dash’d against the floor;<br />these i have yet to see, perhaps yet more!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by the cruel hands of the achaeans; in the end fierce hounds will</p>
    <p class=l>perhaps even i, reserved by angry fate,<br />the last sad relic of my ruin’d state,<br />(dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!<br />) must fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tear me in pieces at my own gates after some one has beaten the</p>
    <p class=l>and stain the pavement of my regal hall;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>life out of my body with sword or spear-hounds that i myself</p>
    <p class=l>where famish’d dogs, late guardians of my door,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>reared and fed at my own table to guard my gates, but who will</p>
    <p class=l>shall lick their mangled master’s spatter’d gore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yet lap my blood and then lie all distraught at my doors.</p>
    <p class=l>yet for my sons i thank ye, gods!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when a</p>
    <p class=l>’tis well;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>young man falls by the sword in battle, he may lie where he is</p>
    <p class=l>well have they perish’d, for in fight they fell.<br />who dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and there is nothing unseemly; let what will be seen, all is</p>
    <p class=l>struck through with wounds, all honest on the breast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>honourable in death, but when an old man is slain there is</p>
    <p class=l>but when the fates, in fulness of their rage,<br />spurn the hoar head of unresisting age,<br />in dust the reverend lineaments deform,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nothing in this world more pitiable than that dogs should defile</p>
    <p class=l>and pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm:<br />this, this is misery!<br />the last, the worse,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his grey hair and beard and all that men hide for shame.</p>
    <p class=l>that man can feel!<br />man, fated to be cursed!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not the</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and acting what no words could say,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heart of hector.</p>
    <p class=l>rent from his head the silver locks away.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as she</p>
    <p class=l>with him the mournful mother bears a part;<br />yet all her sorrows turn not hector’s heart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bared her bosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him.</p>
    <p class=l>the zone unbraced, her bosom she display’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“hector,” she cried, weeping bitterly the while, “hector, my son,</p>
    <p class=l>and thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:<br />“have mercy on me, o my son!<br />revere<br />the words of age; attend a parent’s prayer!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spurn not this breast, but have pity upon me too: if i have ever</p>
    <p class=l>if ever thee in these fond arms i press’d,<br />or still’d thy infant clamours at this breast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>given you comfort from my own bosom, think on it now, dear son,</p>
    <p class=l>ah do not thus our helpless years forego,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and come within the wall to protect us from this man; stand not</p>
    <p class=l>but, by our walls secured, repel the foe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>without to meet him.</p>
    <p class=l>against his rage if singly thou proceed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should the wretch kill you, neither i nor</p>
    <p class=l>should’st thou, (but heaven avert it!<br />) should’st thou bleed,<br />nor must thy corse lie honour’d on the bier,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your richly dowered wife shall ever weep, dear offshoot of</p>
    <p class=l>nor spouse, nor mother, grace thee with a tear!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>myself, over the bed on which you lie, for dogs will devour you</p>
    <p class=l>far from our pious rites those dear remains</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at the ships of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>must feast the vultures on the naked plains.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they</p>
    <p class=l>so they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moved not the heart of hector, and he stood his ground awaiting</p>
    <p class=l>but fix’d remains the purpose of his soul;<br />resolved he stands, and with a fiery glance</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>huge achilles as he drew nearer towards him.</p>
    <p class=l>expects the hero’s terrible advance.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as a serpent in its</p>
    <p class=l>so, roll’d up in his den, the swelling snake<br />beholds the traveller approach the brake;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>den upon the mountains, full fed with deadly poisons, waits for</p>
    <p class=l>when fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins<br />have gather’d half the poisons of the plains;<br />he burns, he stiffens with collected ire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the approach of man—he is filled with fury and his eyes glare</p>
    <p class=l>and his red eyeballs glare with living fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>terribly as he goes writhing round his den—even so hector leaned<br />his shield against a tower that jutted out from the wall and</p>
    <p class=l>beneath a turret, on his shield reclined,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stood where he was, undaunted.</p>
    <p class=l>he stood, and question’d thus his mighty mind:[275]<br />“where lies my way?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“alas,” said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, “if i</p>
    <p class=l>to enter in the wall?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>go within the gates, polydamas will be the first to heap reproach</p>
    <p class=l>honour and shame the ungenerous thought recall:<br />shall proud polydamas before the gate</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upon me, for it was he that urged me to lead the trojans back to</p>
    <p class=l>proclaim, his counsels are obey’d too late,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the city on that awful night when achilles again came forth</p>
    <p class=l>which timely follow’d but the former night,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against us.</p>
    <p class=l>what numbers had been saved by hector’s flight?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i would not listen, but it would have been indeed</p>
    <p class=l>that wise advice rejected with disdain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>better if i had done so.</p>
    <p class=l>i feel my folly in my people slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now that my folly has destroyed the</p>
    <p class=l>methinks my suffering country’s voice i hear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>host, i dare not look trojan men and trojan women in the face,</p>
    <p class=l>but most her worthless sons insult my ear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lest a worse man should say, ‘hector has ruined us by his</p>
    <p class=l>on my rash courage charge the chance of war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>self-confidence.</p>
    <p class=l>and blame those virtues which they cannot share.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>’ surely it would be better for me to return</p>
    <p class=l>no—if i e’er return, return i must</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after having fought achilles and slain him, or to die gloriously</p>
    <p class=l>glorious, my country’s terror laid in dust:<br />or if i perish, let her see me fall</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>here before the city.</p>
    <p class=l>in field at least, and fighting for her wall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what, again, if i were to lay down my</p>
    <p class=l>and yet suppose these measures i forego,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shield and helmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight</p>
    <p class=l>approach unarm’d, and parley with the foe,<br />the warrior-shield, the helm, and lance, lay down,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>up to noble achilles?</p>
    <p class=l>and treat on terms of peace to save the town:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what if i were to promise to give up helen,</p>
    <p class=l>the wife withheld, the treasure ill-detain’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>who was the fountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure</p>
    <p class=l>(cause of the war, and grievance of the land)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that alexandrus brought with him in his ships to troy, aye, and</p>
    <p class=l>with honourable justice to restore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to let the achaeans divide the half of everything that the city<br />contains among themselves?</p>
    <p class=l>and add half ilion’s yet remaining store,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i might make the trojans, by the<br />mouths of their princes, take a solemn oath that they would hide</p>
    <p class=l>which troy shall, sworn, produce; that injured greece</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nothing, but would divide into two shares all that is within the</p>
    <p class=l>may share our wealth, and leave our walls in peace.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>city—but why argue with myself in this way?</p>
    <p class=l>but why this thought?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were i to go up to</p>
    <p class=l>unarm’d if i should go,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him he would show me no kind of mercy; he would kill me then and</p>
    <p class=l>what hope of mercy from this vengeful foe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there as easily as though i were a woman, when i had off my</p>
    <p class=l>but woman-like to fall, and fall without a blow?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>armour.</p>
    <p class=l>we greet not here, as man conversing man,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there is no parleying with him from some rock or oak tree</p>
    <p class=l>met at an oak, or journeying o’er a plain;<br />no season now for calm familiar talk,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as young men and maidens prattle with one another.</p>
    <p class=l>like youths and maidens in an evening walk:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>better fight</p>
    <p class=l>war is our business, but to whom is given</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him at once, and learn to which of us jove will vouchsafe</p>
    <p class=l>to die, or triumph, that, determine heaven!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>victory.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he stand and ponder, but achilles came up to him as it</p>
    <p class=l>thus pondering, like a god the greek drew nigh;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were mars himself, plumed lord of battle.</p>
    <p class=l>his dreadful plumage nodded from on high;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from his right shoulder<br />he brandished his terrible spear of pelian ash, and the bronze</p>
    <p class=l>the pelian javelin, in his better hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gleamed around him like flashing fire or the rays of the rising</p>
    <p class=l>shot trembling rays that glitter’d o’er the land;<br />and on his breast the beamy splendour shone,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sun.</p>
    <p class=l>like jove’s own lightning, or the rising sun.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fear fell upon hector as he beheld him, and he dared not</p>
    <p class=l>as hector sees, unusual terrors rise,<br />struck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stay longer where he was but fled in dismay from before the</p>
    <p class=l>he leaves the gates, he leaves the wall behind:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gates, while achilles darted after him at his utmost speed.</p>
    <p class=l>achilles follows like the winged wind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as a</p>
    <p class=l>thus at the panting dove a falcon flies</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mountain falcon, swiftest of all birds, swoops down upon some</p>
    <p class=l>(the swiftest racer of the liquid skies),</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cowering dove—the dove flies before him but the falcon with a</p>
    <p class=l>just when he holds, or thinks he holds his prey,<br />obliquely wheeling through the aerial way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shrill scream follows close after, resolved to have her—even so</p>
    <p class=l>with open beak and shrilling cries he springs,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did achilles make straight for hector with all his might, while</p>
    <p class=l>and aims his claws, and shoots upon his wings:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector fled under the trojan wall as fast as his limbs could take</p>
    <p class=l>no less fore-right the rapid chase they held,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him.</p>
    <p class=l>one urged by fury, one by fear impell’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under the</p>
    <p class=l>now circling round the walls their course maintain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wall, past the look-out station, and past the weather-beaten wild</p>
    <p class=l>where the high watch-tower overlooks the plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fig-tree, till they came to two fair springs which feed the river</p>
    <p class=l>now where the fig-trees spread their umbrage broad,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>scamander.</p>
    <p class=l>(a wider compass,) smoke along the road.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one of these two springs is warm, and steam rises from</p>
    <p class=l>next by scamander’s double source they bound,<br />where two famed fountains burst the parted ground;<br />this hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it as smoke from a burning fire, but the other even in summer is</p>
    <p class=l>with exhalations steaming to the skies;<br />that the green banks in summer’s heat o’erflows,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as cold as hail or snow, or the ice that forms on water.</p>
    <p class=l>like crystal clear, and cold as winter snows:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>here,</p>
    <p class=l>each gushing fount a marble cistern fills,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hard by the springs, are the goodly washing-troughs of stone,</p>
    <p class=l>whose polish’d bed receives the falling rills;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>where in the time of peace before the coming of the achaeans the</p>
    <p class=l>where trojan dames (ere yet alarm’d by greece)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wives and fair daughters of the trojans used to wash their</p>
    <p class=l>wash’d their fair garments in the days of peace.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>clothes.</p>
    <p class=l>[276]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>past these did they fly, the one in front and the other</p>
    <p class=l>by these they pass’d, one chasing, one in flight:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>giving chase behind him: good was the man that fled, but better</p>
    <p class=l>(the mighty fled, pursued by stronger might:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>far was he that followed after, and swiftly indeed did they run,</p>
    <p class=l>swift was the course; no vulgar prize they play,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the prize was no mere beast for sacrifice or bullock’s hide,</p>
    <p class=l>no vulgar victim must reward the day:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as it might be for a common foot-race, but they ran for the life<br />of hector.<br />as horses in a chariot race speed round the</p>
    <p class=l>(such as in races crown the speedy strife:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>turning-posts when they are running for some great prize—a tripod</p>
    <p class=l>the prize contended was great hector’s life.<br />as when some hero’s funerals are decreed<br />in grateful honour of the mighty dead;<br />where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame<br />(some golden tripod, or some lovely dame)<br />the panting coursers swiftly turn the goal,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or woman—at the games in honour of some dead hero, so did these</p>
    <p class=l>and with them turns the raised spectator’s soul:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two run full speed three times round the city of priam.</p>
    <p class=l>thus three times round the trojan wall they fly.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all the</p>
    <p class=l>the gazing gods lean forward from the sky;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gods watched them, and the sire of gods and men was the first to</p>
    <p class=l>to whom, while eager on the chase they look,<br />the sire of mortals and immortals spoke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>speak.</p>
    <p class=l>“unworthy sight!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“alas,” said he, “my eyes behold a man who is dear to me being</p>
    <p class=l>the man beloved of heaven,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pursued round the walls of troy; my heart is full of pity for</p>
    <p class=l>behold, inglorious round yon city driven!<br />my heart partakes the generous hector’s pain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector, who has burned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in my</p>
    <p class=l>hector, whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>honour, one while on the crests of many-valleyed ida, and again</p>
    <p class=l>whose grateful fumes the gods received with joy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on the citadel of troy; and now i see noble achilles in full</p>
    <p class=l>from ida’s summits, and the towers of troy:<br />now see him flying; to his fears resign’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pursuit of him round the city of priam.</p>
    <p class=l>and fate, and fierce achilles, close behind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what say you?</p>
    <p class=l>consult, ye powers!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>consider</p>
    <p class=l>(’tis worthy your debate)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among yourselves and decide whether we shall now save him or let</p>
    <p class=l>whether to snatch him from impending fate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him fall, valiant though he be, before achilles, son of peleus.</p>
    <p class=l>or let him bear, by stern pelides slain,<br />(good as he is) the lot imposed on man.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then minerva said, “father, wielder of the lightning, lord of</p>
    <p class=l>then pallas thus: “shall he whose vengeance forms</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cloud and storm, what mean you?</p>
    <p class=l>the forky bolt, and blackens heaven with storms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would you pluck this mortal whose</p>
    <p class=l>shall he prolong one trojan’s forfeit breath?<br />a man, a mortal, pre-ordain’d to death!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>doom has long been decreed out of the jaws of death?</p>
    <p class=l>and will no murmurs fill the courts above?<br />no gods indignant blame their partial jove?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do as you<br />will, but we others shall not be of a mind with you.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and jove answered, “my child, trito-born, take heart.<br />i did not</p>
    <p class=l>“go then (return’d the sire) without delay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>speak in full earnest, and i will let you have your way.</p>
    <p class=l>exert thy will: i give the fates their way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do<br />without let or hindrance as you are minded.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he urge minerva who was already eager, and down she</p>
    <p class=l>swift at the mandate pleased tritonia flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>darted from the topmost summits of olympus.</p>
    <p class=l>and stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles was still in full pursuit of hector, as a hound chasing</p>
    <p class=l>as through the forest, o’er the vale and lawn,<br />the well-breath’d beagle drives the flying fawn,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a fawn which he has started from its covert on the mountains, and</p>
    <p class=l>in vain he tries the covert of the brakes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hunts through glade and thicket.</p>
    <p class=l>or deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fawn may try to elude him by</p>
    <p class=l>sure of the vapour in the tainted dews,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>crouching under cover of a bush, but he will scent her out and</p>
    <p class=l>the certain hound his various maze pursues.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>follow her up until he gets her—even so there was no escape for</p>
    <p class=l>thus step by step, where’er the trojan wheel’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector from the fleet son of peleus.</p>
    <p class=l>there swift achilles compass’d round the field.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whenever he made a set to<br />get near the dardanian gates and under the walls, that his people</p>
    <p class=l>oft as to reach the dardan gates he bends,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>might help him by showering down weapons from above, achilles</p>
    <p class=l>and hopes the assistance of his pitying friends,<br />(whose showering arrows, as he coursed below,<br />from the high turrets might oppress the foe,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would gain on him and head him back towards the plain, keeping</p>
    <p class=l>so oft achilles turns him to the plain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>himself always on the city side.</p>
    <p class=l>he eyes the city, but he eyes in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as a man in a dream who fails to</p>
    <p class=l>as men in slumbers seem with speedy pace,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lay hands upon another whom he is pursuing—the one cannot escape</p>
    <p class=l>one to pursue, and one to lead the chase,<br />their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nor the other overtake—even so neither could achilles come up</p>
    <p class=l>nor this can fly, nor that can overtake:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with hector, nor hector break away from achilles; nevertheless he</p>
    <p class=l>no less the labouring heroes pant and strain:<br />while that but flies, and this pursues in vain.<br />what god, o muse, assisted hector’s force</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>might even yet have escaped death had not the time come when</p>
    <p class=l>with fate itself so long to hold the course?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo, who thus far had sustained his strength and nerved his</p>
    <p class=l>phœbus it was; who, in his latest hour,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>running, was now no longer to stay by him.</p>
    <p class=l>endued his knees with strength, his nerves with power:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles made signs to</p>
    <p class=l>and great achilles, lest some greek’s advance</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaean host, and shook his head to show that no man was to</p>
    <p class=l>should snatch the glory from his lifted lance,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>aim a dart at hector, lest another might win the glory of having</p>
    <p class=l>sign’d to the troops to yield his foe the way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hit him and he might himself come in second.</p>
    <p class=l>and leave untouch’d the honours of the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then, at last, as</p>
    <p class=l>jove lifts the golden balances, that show</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were nearing the fountains for the fourth time, the father</p>
    <p class=l>the fates of mortal men, and things below:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of all balanced his golden scales and placed a doom in each of</p>
    <p class=l>here each contending hero’s lot he tries,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them, one for achilles and the other for hector.<br />as he held the</p>
    <p class=l>and weighs, with equal hand, their destinies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>scales by the middle, the doom of hector fell down deep into the</p>
    <p class=l>low sinks the scale surcharged with hector’s fate;<br />heavy with death it sinks, and hell receives the weight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>house of hades—and then phoebus apollo left him.</p>
    <p class=l>then phœbus left him.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon minerva</p>
    <p class=l>fierce minerva flies</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went close up to the son of peleus and said, “noble achilles,</p>
    <p class=l>to stern pelides, and triumphing, cries:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>favoured of heaven, we two shall surely take back to the ships a</p>

    <p class=r>triumph for the achaeans by slaying hector, for all his lust of</p>
    <p class=l>and conquest blazes with full beams on greece.<br />great hector falls; that hector famed so far,<br />drunk with renown, insatiable of war,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>battle.</p>
    <p class=l>falls by thy hand, and mine!<br />nor force, nor flight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do what apollo may as he lies grovelling before his</p>
    <p class=l>shall more avail him, nor his god of light.<br />see, where in vain he supplicates above,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father, aegis-bearing jove, hector cannot escape us longer.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stay<br />here and take breath, while i go up to him and persuade him to</p>
    <p class=l>rest here: myself will lead the trojan on,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>make a stand and fight you.</p>
    <p class=l>and urge to meet the fate he cannot shun.</p>

    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus spoke minerva.</p>
    <p class=l>her voice divine the chief with joyful mind</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still,</p>
    <p class=l>obey’d; and rested, on his lance reclined<br />while like deiphobus the martial dame<br />(her face, her gesture, and her arms the same),</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>leaning on his bronze-pointed ashen spear, while minerva left him</p>
    <p class=l>in show an aid, by hapless hector’s side</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and went after hector in the form and with the voice of</p>
    <p class=l>approach’d, and greets him thus with voice belied:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deiphobus.</p>
    <p class=l>“too long, o hector!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she came close up to him and said, “dear brother, i</p>
    <p class=l>have i borne the sight</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see you are hard pressed by achilles who is chasing you at full</p>
    <p class=l>of this distress, and sorrow’d in thy flight:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>speed round the city of priam, let us await his onset and stand</p>
    <p class=l>it fits us now a noble stand to make,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on our defence.</p>
    <p class=l>and here, as brothers, equal fates partake.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and hector answered, “deiphobus, you have always been dearest to</p>
    <p class=l>then he: “o prince!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me of all my brothers, children of hecuba and priam, but</p>
    <p class=l>allied in blood and fame,<br />dearer than all that own a brother’s name;<br />of all that hecuba to priam bore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>henceforth i shall rate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have</p>
    <p class=l>long tried, long loved: much loved, but honoured more!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ventured outside the wall for my sake when all the others remain</p>
    <p class=l>since you, of all our numerous race alone<br />defend my life, regardless of your own.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>inside.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then minerva said, “dear brother, my father and mother went down</p>
    <p class=l>again the goddess: “much my father’s prayer,<br />and much my mother’s, press’d me to forbear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on their knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remain</p>
    <p class=l>my friends embraced my knees, adjured my stay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>inside, so great a fear has fallen upon them all; but i was in an</p>
    <p class=l>but stronger love impell’d, and i obey.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agony of grief when i beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make</p>
    <p class=l>come then, the glorious conflict let us try,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a stand and fight, and let there be no keeping our spears in</p>
    <p class=l>let the steel sparkle, and the javelin fly;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>reserve, that we may learn whether achilles shall kill us and</p>
    <p class=l>or let us stretch achilles on the field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bear off our spoils to the ships, or whether he shall fall before</p>
    <p class=l>or to his arm our bloody trophies yield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the two</p>
    <p class=l>fraudful she said; then swiftly march’d before:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were now close to one another great hector was first to speak.</p>
    <p class=l>the dardan hero shuns his foe no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“i</p>
    <p class=l>sternly they met.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will no longer fly you, son of peleus,” said he, “as i have been</p>
    <p class=l>the silence hector broke:<br />his dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:<br />“enough, o son of peleus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>doing hitherto.</p>
    <p class=l>troy has view’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>three times have i fled round the mighty city of</p>
    <p class=l>her walls thrice circled, and her chief pursued.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam, without daring to withstand you, but now, let me either</p>
    <p class=l>but now some god within me bids me try</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>slay or be slain, for i am in the mind to face you.</p>
    <p class=l>thine, or my fate: i kill thee, or i die.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us, then,</p>
    <p class=l>yet on the verge of battle let us stay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>give pledges to one another by our gods, who are the fittest</p>
    <p class=l>and for a moment’s space suspend the day;<br />let heaven’s high powers be call’d to arbitrate</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>witnesses and guardians of all covenants; let it be agreed</p>
    <p class=l>the just conditions of this stern debate,<br />(eternal witnesses of all below,<br />and faithful guardians of the treasured vow!<br />)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>between us that if jove vouchsafes me the longer stay and i take</p>
    <p class=l>to them i swear; if, victor in the strife,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your life, i am not to treat your dead body in any unseemly</p>
    <p class=l>jove by these hands shall shed thy noble life,<br />no vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fashion, but when i have stripped you of your armour, i am to</p>
    <p class=l>stripp’d of its arms alone (the conqueror’s due)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>give up your body to the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the rest to greece uninjured i’ll restore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and do you likewise.</p>
    <p class=l>now plight thy mutual oath, i ask no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles glared at him and answered, “fool, prate not to me about</p>
    <p class=l>“talk not of oaths (the dreadful chief replies,<br />while anger flash’d from his disdainful eyes),</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>covenants.</p>
    <p class=l>detested as thou art, and ought to be,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there can be no covenants between men and lions,</p>
    <p class=l>nor oath nor pact achilles plights with thee:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wolves and lambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other</p>
    <p class=l>such pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine,<br />such leagues as men and furious lions join,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>out and out all through.</p>
    <p class=l>to such i call the gods!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore there can be no understanding</p>
    <p class=l>one constant state</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>between you and me, nor may there be any covenants between us,</p>
    <p class=l>of lasting rancour and eternal hate:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>till one or other shall fall and glut grim mars with his life’s</p>
    <p class=l>no thought but rage, and never-ceasing strife,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>blood.</p>
    <p class=l>till death extinguish rage, and thought, and life.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>put forth all your strength; you have need now to prove</p>
    <p class=l>rouse then thy forces this important hour,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yourself indeed a bold soldier and man of war.</p>
    <p class=l>collect thy soul, and call forth all thy power.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you have no more</p>
    <p class=l>no further subterfuge, no further chance;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chance, and pallas minerva will forthwith vanquish you by my</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spear: you shall now pay me in full for the grief you have caused</p>
    <p class=l>each grecian ghost, by thee deprived of breath,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me on account of my comrades whom you have killed in battle.</p>
    <p class=l>now hovers round, and calls thee to thy death.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it.</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, and launch’d his javelin at the foe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector saw it</p>
    <p class=l>but hector shunn’d the meditated blow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>coming and avoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it</p>
    <p class=l>he stoop’d, while o’er his head the flying spear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flew over his head and stuck in the ground beyond; minerva then</p>
    <p class=l>sang innocent, and spent its force in air.<br />minerva watch’d it falling on the land,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>snatched it up and gave it back to achilles without hector’s</p>
    <p class=l>then drew, and gave to great achilles’ hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seeing her; hector thereon said to the son of peleus, “you have</p>
    <p class=l>unseen of hector, who, elate with joy,</p>

    <p class=r>missed your aim, achilles, peer of the gods, and jove has not yet</p>

    <p class=r>revealed to you the hour of my doom, though you made sure that he</p>
    <p class=l>“the life you boasted to that javelin given,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had done so.</p>
    <p class=l>prince!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you were a false-tongued liar when you deemed that i</p>
    <p class=l>you have miss’d.<br />my fate depends on heaven,<br />to thee, presumptuous as thou art, unknown,</p>

    <p class=r>should forget my valour and quail before you.</p>
    <p class=l>or what must prove my fortune, or thy own.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you shall not drive</p>
    <p class=l>boasting is but an art, our fears to blind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your spear into the back of a runaway—drive it, should heaven so</p>
    <p class=l>and with false terrors sink another’s mind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it.<br />his aim was true</p>
    <p class=l>the weapon flew, its course unerring held,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for he hit the middle of achilles’ shield, but the spear</p>
    <p class=l>unerring, but the heavenly shield repell’d<br />the mortal dart; resulting with a bound</p>

    <p class=r>rebounded from it, and did not pierce it.</p>
    <p class=l>from off the ringing orb, it struck the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector was angry when<br />he saw that the weapon had sped from his hand in vain, and stood</p>
    <p class=l>hector beheld his javelin fall in vain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there in dismay for he had no second spear.</p>
    <p class=l>nor other lance, nor other hope remain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with a loud cry he</p>
    <p class=l>he calls deiphobus, demands a spear—</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>called deiphobus and asked him for one, but there was no man;</p>
    <p class=l>in vain, for no deiphobus was there.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he saw the truth and said to himself, “alas!</p>
    <p class=l>all comfortless he stands: then, with a sigh;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the gods have</p>
    <p class=l>“’tis so—heaven wills it, and my hour is nigh!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lured me on to my destruction.<br />i deemed that the hero deiphobus</p>
    <p class=l>i deem’d deiphobus had heard my call,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was by my side, but he is within the wall, and minerva has</p>
    <p class=l>but he secure lies guarded in the wall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>inveigled me; death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and</p>
    <p class=l>a god deceived me; pallas, ’twas thy deed,<br />death and black fate approach!<br />’tis i must bleed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there is no way out of it—for so jove and his son apollo the</p>
    <p class=l>no refuge now, no succour from above,<br />great jove deserts me, and the son of jove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever</p>
    <p class=l>propitious once, and kind!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ready to protect me.</p>
    <p class=l>then welcome fate!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my doom has come upon me; let me not then</p>
    <p class=l>’tis true i perish, yet i perish great:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>die ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some</p>
    <p class=l>yet in a mighty deed i shall expire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.</p>
    <p class=l>let future ages hear it, and admire!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong</p>
    <p class=l>fierce, at the word, his weighty sword he drew,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>by his side, and gathering himself together be sprang on achilles</p>
    <p class=l>and, all collected, on achilles flew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like a soaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some<br />lamb or timid hare—even so did hector brandish his sword and</p>
    <p class=l>so jove’s bold bird, high balanced in the air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spring upon achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>stoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles mad with rage darted towards him,</p>
    <p class=l>nor less achilles his fierce soul prepares:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with his wondrous shield before his breast, and his gleaming</p>
    <p class=l>before his breast the flaming shield he bears,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>helmet, made with four layers of metal, nodding fiercely forward.</p>
    <p class=l>refulgent orb!<br />above his fourfold cone</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the thick tresses of gold with which vulcan had crested the</p>
    <p class=l>the gilded horse-hair sparkled in the sun.<br />nodding at every step: (vulcanian frame!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>helmet floated round it, and as the evening star that shines</p>
    <p class=l>)<br />and as he moved, his figure seem’d on flame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brighter than all others through the stillness of night, even</p>
    <p class=l>as radiant hesper shines with keener light,[277]<br />far-beaming o’er the silver host of night,<br />when all the starry train emblaze the sphere:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>such was the gleam of the spear which achilles poised in his</p>
    <p class=l>so shone the point of great achilles’ spear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>right hand, fraught with the death of noble hector.</p>
    <p class=l>in his right hand he waves the weapon round,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he eyed his</p>
    <p class=l>eyes the whole man, and meditates the wound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fair flesh over and over to see where he could best wound it, but</p>
    <p class=l>but the rich mail patroclus lately wore</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all was protected by the goodly armour of which hector had</p>
    <p class=l>securely cased the warrior’s body o’er.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spoiled patroclus after he had slain him, save only the throat</p>
    <p class=l>one space at length he spies, to let in fate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>where the collar-bones divide the neck from the shoulders, and</p>
    <p class=l>where ’twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this is a most deadly place: here then did achilles strike him as</p>
    <p class=l>gave entrance: through that penetrable part</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he was coming on towards him, and the point of his spear went</p>
    <p class=l>furious he drove the well-directed dart:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>right through the fleshy part of the neck, but it did not sever</p>
    <p class=l>nor pierced the windpipe yet, nor took the power</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his windpipe so that he could still speak.</p>
    <p class=l>of speech, unhappy!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector fell headlong,</p>
    <p class=l>from thy dying hour.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and achilles vaunted over him saying, “hector, you deemed that</p>
    <p class=l>prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you should come off scatheless when you were spoiling patroclus,</p>
    <p class=l>while, thus triumphing, stern achilles cries:<br />“at last is hector stretch’d upon the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and recked not of myself who was not with him.</p>
    <p class=l>who fear’d no vengeance for patroclus slain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fool that you</p>
    <p class=l>then, prince!<br />you should have fear’d, what now you feel;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were: for i, his comrade, mightier far than he, was still left</p>
    <p class=l>achilles absent was achilles still:<br />yet a short space the great avenger stayed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>behind him at the ships, and now i have laid you low.</p>
    <p class=l>then low in dust thy strength and glory laid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>peaceful he sleeps, with all our rites adorn’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans shall give him all due funeral rites, while dogs and</p>
    <p class=l>for ever honour’d, and for ever mourn’d:<br />while cast to all the rage of hostile power,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vultures shall work their will upon yourself.</p>
    <p class=l>thee birds shall mangle, and the gods devour.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, “i pray you by</p>
    <p class=l>then hector, fainting at the approach of death:<br />“by thy own soul!<br />by those who gave thee breath!<br />by all the sacred prevalence of prayer;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your life and knees, and by your parents, let not dogs devour me</p>
    <p class=l>ah, leave me not for grecian dogs to tear!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at the ships of the achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of</p>
    <p class=l>the common rites of sepulture bestow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gold and bronze which my father and mother will offer you, and</p>
    <p class=l>to soothe a father’s and a mother’s woe:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>send my body home, that the trojans and their wives may give me</p>
    <p class=l>let their large gifts procure an urn at least,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my dues of fire when i am dead.</p>
    <p class=l>and hector’s ashes in his country rest.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”<br />“no, wretch accursed!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles glared at him and answered, “dog, talk not to me neither</p>
    <p class=l>relentless he replies;<br />(flames, as he spoke, shot flashing from his eyes;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of knees nor parents; would that i could be as sure of being able</p>
    <p class=l>not those who gave me breath should bid me spare,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to cut your flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill you</p>
    <p class=l>nor all the sacred prevalence of prayer.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have done me, as i am that nothing shall save you from the</p>
    <p class=l>could i myself the bloody banquet join!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dogs—it shall not be, though they bring ten or twenty-fold ransom</p>
    <p class=l>no—to the dogs that carcase i resign.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and weigh it out for me on the spot, with promise of yet more</p>
    <p class=l>should troy, to bribe me, bring forth all her store,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hereafter.</p>
    <p class=l>and giving thousands, offer thousands more;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>though priam son of dardanus should bid them offer me</p>
    <p class=l>should dardan priam, and his weeping dame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your weight in gold, even so your mother shall never lay you out</p>
    <p class=l>drain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and make lament over the son she bore, but dogs and vultures</p>
    <p class=l>their hector on the pile they should not see,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall eat you utterly up.</p>
    <p class=l>nor rob the vultures of one limb of thee.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector with his dying breath then said, “i know you what you are,</p>
    <p class=l>then thus the chief his dying accents drew:<br />“thy rage, implacable!<br />too well i knew:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and was sure that i should not move you, for your heart is hard</p>
    <p class=l>the furies that relentless breast have steel’d,<br />and cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as iron; look to it that i bring not heaven’s anger upon you on</p>
    <p class=l>yet think, a day will come, when fate’s decree<br />and angry gods shall wreak this wrong on thee;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the day when paris and phoebus apollo, valiant though you be,</p>
    <p class=l>phœbus and paris shall avenge my fate,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall slay you at the scaean gates.</p>
    <p class=l>and stretch thee here before the scæan gate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”[278]<br />he ceased.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon</p>
    <p class=l>the fates suppress’d his labouring breath,<br />and his eyes stiffen’d at the hand of death;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his soul went out of him and flew down to the house of hades,</p>
    <p class=l>to the dark realm the spirit wings its way,<br />(the manly body left a load of clay,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lamenting its sad fate that it should enjoy youth and strength no</p>
    <p class=l>and plaintive glides along the dreary coast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>longer.</p>
    <p class=l>a naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but achilles said, speaking to the dead body, “die; for</p>
    <p class=l>achilles, musing as he roll’d his eyes<br />o’er the dead hero, thus unheard, replies:<br />“die thou the first!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my part i will accept my fate whensoever jove and the other gods</p>
    <p class=l>when jove and heaven ordain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see fit to send it.<br />”<br />as he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on one</p>
    <p class=l>i follow thee”—he said, and stripp’d the slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>side; then he stripped the blood-stained armour from hector’s</p>
    <p class=l>then forcing backward from the gaping wound<br />the reeking javelin, cast it on the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shoulders while the other achaeans came running up to view his</p>
    <p class=l>the thronging greeks behold with wondering eyes</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wondrous strength and beauty; and no one came near him without</p>
    <p class=l>his manly beauty and superior size;<br />while some, ignobler, the great dead deface</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>giving him a fresh wound.</p>
    <p class=l>with wounds ungenerous, or with taunts disgrace:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then would one turn to his neighbour<br />and say, “it is easier to handle hector now than when he was</p>
    <p class=l>“how changed that hector, who like jove of late</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flinging fire on to our ships”—and as he spoke he would thrust</p>
    <p class=l>sent lightning on our fleets, and scatter’d fate!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his spear into him anew.</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when achilles had done spoiling hector of his armour, he stood</p>
    <p class=l>high o’er the slain the great achilles stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>among the argives and said, “my friends, princes and counsellors</p>
    <p class=l>begirt with heroes and surrounding bands;<br />and thus aloud, while all the host attends:<br />“princes and leaders!<br />countrymen and friends!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the argives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome</p>
    <p class=l>since now at length the powerful will of heaven</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this man, who has done us more hurt than all the others together,<br />consider whether we should not attack the city in force, and</p>
    <p class=l>the dire destroyer to our arm has given,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>discover in what mind the trojans may be.</p>
    <p class=l>is not troy fallen already?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we should thus learn</p>
    <p class=l>haste, ye powers!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whether they will desert their city now that hector has fallen,</p>
    <p class=l>see, if already their deserted towers</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or will still hold out even though he is no longer living.</p>
    <p class=l>are left unmann’d; or if they yet retain<br />the souls of heroes, their great hector slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but</p>
    <p class=l>but what is troy, or glory what to me?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>why argue with myself in this way, while patroclus is still lying</p>
    <p class=l>or why reflects my mind on aught but thee,<br />divine patroclus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at the ships unburied, and unmourned—he whom i can never forget</p>
    <p class=l>death hath seal’d his eyes;<br />unwept, unhonour’d, uninterr’d he lies!<br />can his dear image from my soul depart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so long as i am alive and my strength fails not?</p>
    <p class=l>long as the vital spirit moves my heart?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>though men</p>
    <p class=l>if in the melancholy shades below,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forget their dead when once they are within the house of hades,</p>
    <p class=l>the flames of friends and lovers cease to glow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yet not even there will i forget the comrade whom i have lost.</p>
    <p class=l>yet mine shall sacred last; mine, undecay’d,<br />burn on through death, and animate my shade.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, therefore, achaean youths, let us raise the song of victory</p>
    <p class=l>meanwhile, ye sons of greece, in triumph bring</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and go back to the ships taking this man along with us; for we</p>
    <p class=l>the corpse of hector, and your pæans sing.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have achieved a mighty triumph and have slain noble hector to</p>
    <p class=l>be this the song, slow-moving toward the shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whom the trojans prayed throughout their city as though he were a</p>
    <p class=l>“hector is dead, and ilion is no more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>god.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>””</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this he treated the body of hector with contumely: he pierced</p>
    <p class=l>then his fell soul a thought of vengeance bred;<br />(unworthy of himself, and of the dead;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sinews at the back of both his feet from heel to ancle and</p>
    <p class=l>the nervous ancles bored, his feet he bound</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>passed thongs of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he</p>
    <p class=l>with thongs inserted through the double wound;<br />these fix’d up high behind the rolling wain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>made the body fast to his chariot, letting the head trail upon<br />the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>his graceful head was trail’d along the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then when he had put the goodly armour on the chariot</p>
    <p class=l>proud on his car the insulting victor stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and had himself mounted, he lashed his horses on and they flew</p>
    <p class=l>and bore aloft his arms, distilling blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forward nothing loth.</p>
    <p class=l>he smites the steeds; the rapid chariot flies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the dust rose from hector as he was being</p>
    <p class=l>the sudden clouds of circling dust arise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dragged along, his dark hair flew all abroad, and his head once</p>
    <p class=l>now lost is all that formidable air;<br />the face divine, and long-descending hair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so comely was laid low on earth, for jove had now delivered him</p>
    <p class=l>purple the ground, and streak the sable sand;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into the hands of his foes to do him outrage in his own land.</p>
    <p class=l>deform’d, dishonour’d, in his native land,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus was the head of hector being dishonoured in the dust.</p>
    <p class=l>given to the rage of an insulting throng,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his</p>
    <p class=l>and, in his parents’ sight, now dragg’d along!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mother tore her hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry</p>
    <p class=l>the mother first beheld with sad survey;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as she looked upon her son.</p>
    <p class=l>she rent her tresses, venerable grey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his father made piteous moan, and</p>
    <p class=l>and cast, far off, the regal veils away.<br />with piercing shrieks his bitter fate she moans,<br />while the sad father answers groans with groans,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>throughout the city the people fell to weeping and wailing.</p>
    <p class=l>tears after tears his mournful cheeks o’erflow,<br />and the whole city wears one face of woe:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it</p>
    <p class=l>no less than if the rage of hostile fires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was as though the whole of frowning ilius was being smirched with</p>
    <p class=l>from her foundations curling to her spires,<br />o’er the proud citadel at length should rise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fire.</p>
    <p class=l>and the last blaze send ilion to the skies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hardly could the people hold priam back in his hot haste to</p>
    <p class=l>the wretched monarch of the falling state,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rush without the gates of the city.</p>
    <p class=l>distracted, presses to the dardan gate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he grovelled in the mire and</p>
    <p class=l>scarce the whole people stop his desperate course,<br />while strong affliction gives the feeble force:<br />grief tears his heart, and drives him to and fro,<br />in all the raging impotence of woe.<br />at length he roll’d in dust, and thus begun,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>besought them, calling each one of them by his name.</p>
    <p class=l>imploring all, and naming one by one:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“let be, my</p>
    <p class=l>“ah!<br />let me, let me go where sorrow calls;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>friends,” he cried, “and for all your sorrow, suffer me to go</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like a maniac, with her waiting-women following after.<br />when she<br />reached the battlements and the crowd of people, she stood</p>
    <p class=l>flies through the dome (the maids her steps pursue),</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>looking out upon the wall, and saw hector being borne away in</p>

    <p class=r>over the ground towards the ships of the achaeans.</p>
    <p class=l>the godlike hector dragg’d along the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her eyes were<br />then shrouded as with the darkness of night and she fell fainting</p>
    <p class=l>a sudden darkness shades her swimming eyes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>backwards.</p>
    <p class=l>she faints, she falls; her breath, her colour flies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she tore the attiring from her head and flung it from</p>
    <p class=l>her hair’s fair ornaments, the braids that bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her, the frontlet and net with its plaited band, and the veil<br />which golden venus had given her on the day when hector took her</p>
    <p class=l>the net that held them, and the wreath that crown’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and came to herself, she sobbed and made lament among the trojans</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sands of the sea-shore and the men’s armour</p>
    <p class=l>the troops obey’d; and thrice in order led[281]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were wet with their weeping, so great a minister of fear was he</p>
    <p class=l>(achilles first) their coursers round the dead;<br />and thrice their sorrows and laments renew;<br />tears bathe their arms, and tears the sands bedew.<br />for such a warrior thetis aids their woe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whom they had lost.</p>
    <p class=l>melts their strong hearts, and bids their eyes to flow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chief in all their mourning was the son of</p>
    <p class=l>but chief, pelides: thick-succeeding sighs</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>peleus: he laid his blood-stained hand on the breast of his</p>
    <p class=l>burst from his heart, and torrents from his eyes:<br />his slaughtering hands, yet red with blood, he laid<br />on his dead friend’s cold breast, and thus he said:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>friend.</p>
    <p class=l>“all hail, patroclus!<br />let thy honour’d ghost</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“fare well,” he cried, “patroclus, even in the house of</p>
    <p class=l>hear, and rejoice on pluto’s dreary coast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hades.</p>
    <p class=l>behold!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will now do all that i erewhile promised you; i will</p>
    <p class=l>achilles’ promise is complete;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drag hector hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve noble sons</p>
    <p class=l>the bloody hector stretch’d before thy feet.<br />lo!<br />to the dogs his carcase i resign;<br />and twelve sad victims, of the trojan line,<br />sacred to vengeance, instant shall expire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of trojans will i also slay before your pyre to avenge you.</p>
    <p class=l>their lives effused around thy funeral pyre.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he treated the body of noble hector with contumely,</p>
    <p class=l>gloomy he said, and (horrible to view)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>laying it at full length in the dust beside the bier of</p>
    <p class=l>before the bier the bleeding hector threw,<br />prone on the dust.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>the myrmidons around</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the others then put off every man his armour, took the<br />horses from their chariots, and seated themselves in great</p>
    <p class=l>unbraced their armour, and the steeds unbound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>multitude by the ship of the fleet descendant of aeacus, who</p>
    <p class=l>all to achilles’ sable ship repair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon feasted them with an abundant funeral banquet.</p>
    <p class=l>frequent and full, the genial feast to share.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many a</p>
    <p class=l>now from the well-fed swine black smokes aspire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>goodly ox, with many a sheep and bleating goat did they butcher</p>
    <p class=l>the bristly victims hissing o’er the fire:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and cut up; many a tusked boar moreover, fat and well-fed, did</p>
    <p class=l>the huge ox bellowing falls; with feebler cries</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they singe and set to roast in the flames of vulcan; and rivulets</p>
    <p class=l>expires the goat; the sheep in silence dies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of blood flowed all round the place where the body was lying.</p>
    <p class=l>around the hero’s prostrate body flow’d,<br />in one promiscuous stream, the reeking blood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then the princes of the achaeans took the son of peleus to</p>
    <p class=l>and now a band of argive monarchs brings<br />the glorious victor to the king of kings.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>agamemnon, but hardly could they persuade him to come with them,<br />so wroth was he for the death of his comrade.</p>
    <p class=l>from his dead friend the pensive warrior went,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as soon as they</p>
    <p class=l>with steps unwilling, to the regal tent.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>reached agamemnon’s tent they told the serving-men to set a large</p>
    <p class=l>the attending heralds, as by office bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tripod over the fire in case they might persuade the son of</p>
    <p class=l>with kindled flames the tripod-vase surround:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>peleus to wash the clotted gore from this body, but he denied</p>
    <p class=l>to cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them sternly, and swore it with a solemn oath, saying, “nay, by</p>
    <p class=l>they urged in vain; the chief refused, and swore:[282]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>king jove, first and mightiest of all gods, it is not meet that</p>
    <p class=l>“no drop shall touch me, by almighty jove!<br />the first and greatest of the gods above!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>water should touch my body, till i have laid patroclus on the</p>
    <p class=l>till on the pyre i place thee; till i rear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flames, have built him a barrow, and shaved my head—for so long</p>
    <p class=l>the grassy mound, and clip thy sacred hair.<br />some ease at least those pious rites may give,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as i live no such second sorrow shall ever draw nigh me.</p>
    <p class=l>and soothe my sorrows, while i bear to live.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now,</p>
    <p class=l>howe’er, reluctant as i am, i stay</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, let us do all that this sad festival demands, but at</p>
    <p class=l>and share your feast; but with the dawn of day,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>break of day, king agamemnon, bid your men bring wood, and</p>
    <p class=l>(o king of men!<br />) it claims thy royal care,<br />that greece the warrior’s funeral pile prepare,<br />and bid the forests fall: (such rites are paid</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>provide all else that the dead may duly take into the realm of</p>
    <p class=l>to heroes slumbering in eternal shade:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>darkness; the fire shall thus burn him out of our sight the</p>
    <p class=l>then, when his earthly part shall mount in fire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sooner, and the people shall turn again to their own labours.</p>
    <p class=l>let the leagued squadrons to their posts retire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said.<br />they made</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke: they hear him, and the word obey;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>haste to prepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full</p>
    <p class=l>the rage of hunger and of thirst allay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>share so that all were satisfied.<br />as soon as they had had enough<br />to eat and drink, the others went to their rest each in his own</p>
    <p class=l>then ease in sleep the labours of the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tent, but the son of peleus lay grieving among his myrmidons by</p>
    <p class=l>but great pelides, stretch’d along the shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the shore of the sounding sea, in an open place where the waves</p>
    <p class=l>where, dash’d on rocks, the broken billows roar,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came surging in one after another.</p>
    <p class=l>lies inly groaning; while on either hand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>here a very deep slumber took</p>
    <p class=l>the martial myrmidons confusedly stand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hold upon him and eased the burden of his sorrows, for his limbs</p>
    <p class=l>along the grass his languid members fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were weary with chasing hector round windy ilius.</p>
    <p class=l>tired with his chase around the trojan wall;<br />hush’d by the murmurs of the rolling deep,<br />at length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>presently the</p>
    <p class=l>when lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sad spirit of patroclus drew near him, like what he had been in</p>
    <p class=l>the shade, before his closing eyes,<br />of sad patroclus rose, or seem’d to rise:<br />in the same robe he living wore, he came:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stature, voice, and the light of his beaming eyes, clad, too, as</p>
    <p class=l>in stature, voice, and pleasing look, the same.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he had been clad in life.<br />the spirit hovered over his head and</p>
    <p class=l>the form familiar hover’d o’er his head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said—</p>
    <p class=l>“and sleeps achilles?<br />(thus the phantom said:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“you sleep, achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living,</p>
    <p class=l>sleeps my achilles, his patroclus dead?<br />living, i seem’d his dearest, tenderest care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but now that i am dead you think for me no further.</p>
    <p class=l>but now forgot, i wander in the air.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bury me with</p>
    <p class=l>let my pale corse the rites of burial know,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all speed that i may pass the gates of hades; the ghosts, vain</p>
    <p class=l>and give me entrance in the realms below:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shadows of men that can labour no more, drive me away from them;</p>
    <p class=l>till then the spirit finds no resting-place,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they will not yet suffer me to join those that are beyond the</p>
    <p class=l>but here and there the unbodied spectres chase</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>river, and i wander all desolate by the wide gates of the house</p>
    <p class=l>the vagrant dead around the dark abode,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of hades.</p>
    <p class=l>forbid to cross the irremeable flood.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>give me now your hand i pray you, for when you have</p>
    <p class=l>now give thy hand; for to the farther shore</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>once given me my dues of fire, never shall i again come forth out</p>
    <p class=l>when once we pass, the soul returns no more:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the house of hades.</p>
    <p class=l>when once the last funereal flames ascend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevermore shall we sit apart and take</p>
    <p class=l>no more shall meet achilles and his friend;<br />no more our thoughts to those we loved make known;<br />or quit the dearest, to converse alone.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sweet counsel among the living; the cruel fate which was my</p>
    <p class=l>me fate has sever’d from the sons of earth,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>birth-right has yawned its wide jaws around me—nay, you too</p>
    <p class=l>the fate fore-doom’d that waited from my birth:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles, peer of gods, are doomed to die beneath the wall of the</p>
    <p class=l>thee too it waits; before the trojan wall</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>noble trojans.</p>
    <p class=l>even great and godlike thou art doom’d to fall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“one prayer more will i make you, if you will grant it; let not</p>
    <p class=l>hear then; and as in fate and love we join,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>my bones be laid apart from yours, achilles, but with them; even</p>
    <p class=l>ah suffer that my bones may rest with thine!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as we were brought up together in your own home, what time<br />menoetius brought me to you as a child from opoeis because by a<br />sad spite i had killed the son of amphidamas—not of set purpose,<br />but in childish quarrel over the dice.<br />the knight peleus took me</p>
    <p class=l>together have we lived; together bred,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into his house, entreated me kindly, and named me to be your<br />squire; therefore let our bones lie in but a single urn, the</p>
    <p class=l>one house received us, and one table fed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two-handled golden vase given to you by your mother.</p>
    <p class=l>that golden urn, thy goddess-mother gave,<br />may mix our ashes in one common grave.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and achilles answered, “why, true heart, are you come hither to</p>
    <p class=l>“and is it thou?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lay these charges upon me?<br />i will of my own self do all as you<br />have bidden me.</p>
    <p class=l>(he answers) to my sight[283]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>draw closer to me, let us once more throw our</p>
    <p class=l>once more return’st thou from the realms of night?<br />o more than brother!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>arms around one another, and find sad comfort in the sharing of</p>
    <p class=l>think each office paid,<br />whate’er can rest a discontented shade;<br />but grant one last embrace, unhappy boy!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>our sorrows.</p>
    <p class=l>afford at least that melancholy joy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he opened his arms towards him as he spoke and would have clasped</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and with his longing arms essay’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him in them, but there was nothing, and the spirit vanished as a</p>
    <p class=l>in vain to grasp the visionary shade!<br />like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly,[284]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>vapour, gibbering and whining into the earth.</p>
    <p class=l>and hears a feeble, lamentable cry.<br />confused he wakes; amazement breaks the bands</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles sprang to</p>
    <p class=l>of golden sleep, and starting from the sands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his feet, smote his two hands, and made lamentation saying, “of a</p>
    <p class=l>pensive he muses with uplifted hands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>truth even in the house of hades there are ghosts and phantoms</p>
    <p class=l>“’tis true, ’tis certain; man, though dead, retains<br />part of himself; the immortal mind remains:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that have no life in them; all night long the sad spirit of</p>
    <p class=l>the form subsists without the body’s aid,<br />aerial semblance, and an empty shade!<br />this night my friend, so late in battle lost,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus has hovered over head making piteous moan, telling me</p>
    <p class=l>stood at my side, a pensive, plaintive ghost:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what i am to do for him, and looking wondrously like himself.</p>
    <p class=l>even now familiar, as in life, he came;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>alas!<br />how different!<br />yet how like the same!<br />”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourning</p>
    <p class=l>thus while he spoke, each eye grew big with tears:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>about the poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn appeared.</p>
    <p class=l>and now the rosy-finger’d morn appears,<br />shows every mournful face with tears o’erspread,<br />and glares on the pale visage of the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then</p>
    <p class=l>but agamemnon, as the rites demand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>king agamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to</p>
    <p class=l>with mules and waggons sends a chosen band</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bring wood, and meriones, squire to idomeneus, was in charge over</p>
    <p class=l>to load the timber, and the pile to rear;<br />a charge consign’d to merion’s faithful care.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them.</p>
    <p class=l>with proper instruments they take the road,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they went out with woodmen’s axes and strong ropes in their</p>
    <p class=l>axes to cut, and ropes to sling the load.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hands, and before them went the mules.</p>
    <p class=l>first march the heavy mules, securely slow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>up hill and down dale did</p>
    <p class=l>o’er hills, o’er dales, o’er crags, o’er rocks they go:[285]<br />jumping, high o’er the shrubs of the rough ground,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they go, by straight ways and crooked, and when they reached the</p>
    <p class=l>rattle the clattering cars, and the shock’d axles bound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heights of many-fountained ida, they laid their axes to the roots</p>
    <p class=l>but when arrived at ida’s spreading woods,[286]<br />(fair ida, water’d with descending floods,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of many a tall branching oak that came thundering down as they</p>
    <p class=l>loud sounds the axe, redoubling strokes on strokes;<br />on all sides round the forest hurls her oaks</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>felled it.</p>
    <p class=l>headlong.<br />deep echoing groan the thickets brown;<br />then rustling, crackling, crashing, thunder down.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they split the trees and bound them behind the mules,</p>
    <p class=l>the wood the grecians cleave, prepared to burn;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which then wended their way as they best could through the thick</p>
    <p class=l>and the slow mules the same rough road return.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brushwood on to the plain.<br />all who had been cutting wood bore</p>
    <p class=l>the sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>logs, for so meriones squire to idomeneus had bidden them, and<br />they threw them down in a line upon the sea-shore at the place</p>
    <p class=l>(such charge was given them) to the sandy shore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>where achilles would make a mighty monument for patroclus and for</p>
    <p class=l>there on the spot which great achilles show’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>himself.</p>
    <p class=l>they eased their shoulders, and disposed the load;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the whole</p>
    <p class=l>circling around the place, where times to come</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ground, they stayed all of them where they were, but achilles</p>
    <p class=l>shall view patroclus’ and achilles’ tomb.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ordered his brave myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yoke</p>
    <p class=l>the hero bids his martial troops appear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>each man his horses; they therefore rose, girded on their armour</p>
    <p class=l>high on their cars in all the pomp of war;<br />each in refulgent arms his limbs attires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and mounted each his chariot—they and their charioteers with<br />them.</p>
    <p class=l>all mount their chariots, combatants and squires.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the chariots went before, and they that were on foot</p>
    <p class=l>the chariots first proceed, a shining train;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>followed as a cloud in their tens of thousands after.</p>
    <p class=l>then clouds of foot that smoke along the plain;<br />next these the melancholy band appear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the</p>
    <p class=l>amidst, lay dead patroclus on the bier;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>midst of them his comrades bore patroclus and covered him with</p>
    <p class=l>o’er all the corse their scattered locks they throw;<br />achilles next, oppress’d with mighty woe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the locks of their hair which they cut off and threw upon his</p>
    <p class=l>supporting with his hands the hero’s head,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body.</p>
    <p class=l>bends o’er the extended body of the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>last came achilles with his head bowed for sorrow, so noble</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus decent on the appointed ground</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a comrade was he taking to the house of hades.<br />when they came to the place of which achilles had told them they<br />laid the body down and built up the wood.</p>
    <p class=l>they place, and heap the sylvan pile around.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles then bethought</p>
    <p class=l>but great achilles stands apart in prayer,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him of another matter.</p>
    <p class=l>and from his head divides the yellow hair;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he went a space away from the pyre, and</p>
    <p class=l>those curling locks which from his youth he vow’d,[287]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cut off the yellow lock which he had let grow for the river</p>
    <p class=l>and sacred grew, to sperchius’ honour’d flood:<br />then sighing, to the deep his locks he cast,<br />and roll’d his eyes around the watery waste:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spercheius.</p>
    <p class=l>“sperchius!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he looked all sorrowfully out upon the dark sea, and</p>
    <p class=l>whose waves in mazy errors lost</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said, “spercheius, in vain did my father peleus vow to you that</p>
    <p class=l>delightful roll along my native coast!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when i returned home to my loved native land i should cut off</p>
    <p class=l>to whom we vainly vow’d, at our return,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this lock and offer you a holy hecatomb; fifty she-goats was i to</p>
    <p class=l>these locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn:<br />full fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sacrifice to you there at your springs, where is your grove and</p>
    <p class=l>where to the day thy silver fountains rise,<br />and where in shade of consecrated bowers</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your altar fragrant with burnt-offerings.</p>
    <p class=l>thy altars stand, perfumed with native flowers!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did my father vow,</p>
    <p class=l>so vow’d my father, but he vow’d in vain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but you have not fulfilled his prayer; now, therefore, that i</p>
    <p class=l>no more achilles sees his native plain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shall see my home no more, i give this lock as a keepsake to the</p>
    <p class=l>in that vain hope these hairs no longer grow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hero patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>patroclus bears them to the shades below.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade,</p>
    <p class=l>thus o’er patroclus while the hero pray’d,<br />on his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and all who stood by were filled with yearning and lamentation.</p>
    <p class=l>once more afresh the grecian sorrows flow:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sun would have gone down upon their mourning had not achilles</p>
    <p class=l>and now the sun had set upon their woe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>presently said to agamemnon, “son of atreus, for it is to you</p>
    <p class=l>but to the king of men thus spoke the chief:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that the people will give ear, there is a time to mourn and a</p>
    <p class=l>“enough, atrides!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>time to cease from mourning; bid the people now leave the pyre</p>
    <p class=l>give the troops relief:<br />permit the mourning legions to retire,<br />and let the chiefs alone attend the pyre;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and set about getting their dinners: we, to whom the dead is</p>
    <p class=l>the pious care be ours, the dead to burn—”<br />he said: the people to their ships return:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dearest, will see to what is wanted here, and let the other</p>
    <p class=l>while those deputed to inter the slain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>princes also stay by me.</p>
    <p class=l>heap with a rising pyramid the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”<br />when king agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to their</p>
    <p class=l>[288]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships, but those who were about the dead heaped up wood and built<br />a pyre a hundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead</p>
    <p class=l>a hundred foot in length, a hundred wide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all sorrowfully upon the top of it.</p>
    <p class=l>the growing structure spreads on every side;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they flayed and dressed many</p>
    <p class=l>high on the top the manly corse they lay,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fat sheep and oxen before the pyre, and achilles took fat from</p>
    <p class=l>and well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay:<br />achilles covered with their fat the dead,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all of them and wrapped the body therein from head to foot,</p>
    <p class=l>and the piled victims round the body spread;<br />then jars of honey, and of fragrant oil,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heaping the flayed carcases all round it.</p>
    <p class=l>suspends around, low-bending o’er the pile.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against the bier he<br />leaned two-handled jars of honey and unguents; four proud horses</p>
    <p class=l>four sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did he then cast upon the pyre, groaning the while he did so.</p>
    <p class=l>pour forth their lives, and on the pyre are thrown.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the<br />dead hero had had house-dogs; two of them did achilles slay and</p>
    <p class=l>of nine large dogs, domestic at his board,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>threw upon the pyre; he also put twelve brave sons of noble</p>
    <p class=l>fall two, selected to attend their lord,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trojans to the sword and laid them with the rest, for he was full</p>
    <p class=l>then last of all, and horrible to tell,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of bitterness and fury.</p>
    <p class=l>sad sacrifice!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he committed all to the resistless</p>
    <p class=l>twelve trojan captives fell.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and devouring might of the fire; he groaned aloud and called on</p>
    <p class=l>[289]<br />on these the rage of fire victorious preys,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his dead comrade by name.</p>
    <p class=l>involves and joins them in one common blaze.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“fare well,” he cried, “patroclus, even</p>
    <p class=l>smear’d with the bloody rites, he stands on high,<br />and calls the spirit with a dreadful cry:[290]<br />“all hail, patroclus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the house of hades; i am now doing all that i have promised</p>
    <p class=l>let thy vengeful ghost</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you.</p>
    <p class=l>hear, and exult, on pluto’s dreary coast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>twelve brave sons of noble trojans shall the flames consume</p>
    <p class=l>behold achilles’ promise fully paid,<br />twelve trojan heroes offer’d to thy shade;<br />but heavier fates on hector’s corse attend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>along with yourself, but dogs, not fire, shall devour the flesh</p>
    <p class=l>saved from the flames, for hungry dogs to rend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of hector son of priam.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of</p>
    <p class=l>so spake he, threatening: but the gods made vain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector, for jove’s daughter venus kept them off him night and</p>
    <p class=l>his threat, and guard inviolate the slain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>day, and anointed him with ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh</p>
    <p class=l>celestial venus hover’d o’er his head,<br />and roseate unguents, heavenly fragrance!<br />shed:<br />she watch’d him all the night and all the day,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>might not be torn when achilles was dragging him about.</p>
    <p class=l>and drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>phoebus</p>
    <p class=l>nor sacred phœbus less employ’d his care;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo moreover sent a dark cloud from heaven to earth, which</p>
    <p class=l>he pour’d around a veil of gather’d air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gave shade to the whole place where hector lay, that the heat of</p>
    <p class=l>and kept the nerves undried, the flesh entire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sun might not parch his body.</p>
    <p class=l>against the solar beam and sirian fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now the pyre about dead patroclus would not kindle.</p>
    <p class=l>[illustration: ] the funeral pile of patroclus<br />nor yet the pile, where dead patroclus lies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles</p>
    <p class=l>smokes, nor as yet the sullen flames arise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore bethought him of another matter; he went apart and</p>
    <p class=l>but, fast beside, achilles stood in prayer,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>prayed to the two winds boreas and zephyrus vowing them goodly</p>
    <p class=l>invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>offerings.</p>
    <p class=l>and victims promised, and libations cast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he made them many drink-offerings from the golden cup</p>
    <p class=l>to gentle zephyr and the boreal blast:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and besought them to come and help him that the wood might make</p>
    <p class=l>he call’d the aerial powers, along the skies</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>haste to kindle and the dead bodies be consumed.</p>
    <p class=l>to breathe, and whisper to the fires to rise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fleet iris heard</p>
    <p class=l>the winged iris heard the hero’s call,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him praying and started off to fetch the winds.<br />they were holding</p>
    <p class=l>and instant hasten’d to their airy hall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>high feast in the house of boisterous zephyrus when iris came</p>
    <p class=l>where in old zephyr’s open courts on high,<br />sat all the blustering brethren of the sky.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>running up to the stone threshold of the house and stood there,</p>
    <p class=l>she shone amidst them, on her painted bow;<br />the rocky pavement glitter’d with the show.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but as soon as they set eyes on her they all came towards her and</p>
    <p class=l>all from the banquet rise, and each invites</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>each of them called her to him, but iris would not sit down.</p>
    <p class=l>the various goddess to partake the rites.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“i</p>
    <p class=l>“not so (the dame replied), i haste to go</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cannot stay,” she said, “i must go back to the streams of oceanus</p>
    <p class=l>to sacred ocean, and the floods below:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and the land of the ethiopians who are offering hecatombs to the</p>
    <p class=l>even now our solemn hecatombs attend,<br />and heaven is feasting on the world’s green end<br />with righteous ethiops (uncorrupted train!<br />)<br />far on the extremest limits of the main.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>immortals, and i would have my share; but achilles prays that</p>
    <p class=l>but peleus’ son entreats, with sacrifice,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>boreas and shrill zephyrus will come to him, and he vows them</p>
    <p class=l>the western spirit, and the north, to rise!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>goodly offerings; he would have you blow upon the pyre of</p>
    <p class=l>let on patroclus’ pile your blast be driven,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus for whom all the achaeans are lamenting.</p>
    <p class=l>and bear the blazing honours high to heaven.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that</p>
    <p class=l>swift as the word she vanish’d from their view;<br />swift as the word the winds tumultuous flew;<br />forth burst the stormy band with thundering roar,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rent the air and swept the clouds before them.</p>
    <p class=l>and heaps on heaps the clouds are toss’d before.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they blew on and</p>
    <p class=l>to the wide main then stooping from the skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on until they came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath</p>
    <p class=l>the heaving deeps in watery mountains rise:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them, but when they reached troy they fell upon the pyre till the</p>
    <p class=l>troy feels the blast along her shaking walls,<br />till on the pile the gather’d tempest falls.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty flames roared under the blast that they blew.</p>
    <p class=l>the structure crackles in the roaring fires,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all night<br />long did they blow hard and beat upon the fire, and all night</p>
    <p class=l>and all the night the plenteous flame aspires.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>long did achilles grasp his double cup, drawing wine from a</p>
    <p class=l>all night achilles hails patroclus’ soul,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mixing-bowl of gold, and calling upon the spirit of dead</p>
    <p class=l>with large libations from the golden bowl.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus as he poured it upon the ground until the earth was<br />drenched.<br />as a father mourns when he is burning the bones of his</p>
    <p class=l>as a poor father, helpless and undone,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts of his parents,</p>
    <p class=l>mourns o’er the ashes of an only son,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so did achilles mourn while burning the body of his comrade,</p>
    <p class=l>takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn,<br />and pours in tears, ere yet they close the urn:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pacing round the bier with piteous groaning and lamentation.</p>
    <p class=l>so stay’d achilles, circling round the shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at length as the morning star was beginning to herald the light</p>
    <p class=l>so watch’d the flames, till now they flame no more.<br />’twas when, emerging through the shades of night,<br />the morning planet told the approach of light;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which saffron-mantled dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, the</p>
    <p class=l>and, fast behind, aurora’s warmer ray<br />o’er the broad ocean pour’d the golden day:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>flames fell and the fire began to die.</p>
    <p class=l>then sank the blaze, the pile no longer burn’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the winds then went home</p>
    <p class=l>and to their caves the whistling winds return’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beyond the thracian sea, which roared and boiled as they swept</p>
    <p class=l>across the thracian seas their course they bore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over it.</p>
    <p class=l>the ruffled seas beneath their passage roar.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of peleus now turned away from the pyre and lay</p>
    <p class=l>then parting from the pile he ceased to weep,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>down, overcome with toil, till he fell into a sweet slumber.</p>
    <p class=l>and sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep,<br />exhausted with his grief: meanwhile the crowd</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>presently they who were about the son of atreus drew near in a</p>
    <p class=l>of thronging grecians round achilles stood;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>body, and roused him with the noise and tramp of their coming.</p>
    <p class=l>the tumult waked him: from his eyes he shook</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he</p>
    <p class=l>unwilling slumber, and the chiefs bespoke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sat upright and said, “son of atreus, and all other princes of</p>
    <p class=l>“ye kings and princes of the achaian name!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans, first pour red wine everywhere upon the fire and</p>
    <p class=l>first let us quench the yet remaining flame<br />with sable wine; then, as the rites direct,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quench it; let us then gather the bones of patroclus son of</p>
    <p class=l>the hero’s bones with careful view select:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menoetius, singling them out with care; they are easily found,</p>
    <p class=l>(apart, and easy to be known they lie</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for they lie in the middle of the pyre, while all else, both men</p>
    <p class=l>amidst the heap, and obvious to the eye:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and horses, has been thrown in a heap and burned at the outer</p>
    <p class=l>the rest around the margin will be seen</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>edge.</p>
    <p class=l>promiscuous, steeds and immolated men:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we will lay the bones in a golden urn, in two layers of</p>
    <p class=l>these wrapp’d in double cauls of fat, prepare;<br />and in the golden vase dispose with care;<br />there let them rest with decent honour laid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fat, against the time when i shall myself go down into the house<br />of hades.</p>
    <p class=l>till i shall follow to the infernal shade.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as for the barrow, labour not to raise a great one now,</p>
    <p class=l>meantime erect the tomb with pious hands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but such as is reasonable.</p>
    <p class=l>a common structure on the humble sands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>afterwards, let those achaeans who may</p>
    <p class=l>hereafter greece some nobler work may raise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be left at the ships when i am gone, build it both broad and</p>
    <p class=l>and late posterity record our praise!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>high.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of peleus.</p>
    <p class=l>the greeks obey; where yet the embers glow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first they poured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and</p>
    <p class=l>wide o’er the pile the sable wine they throw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quenched the fire.</p>
    <p class=l>and deep subsides the ashy heap below.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with many tears they singled out the whitened</p>
    <p class=l>next the white bones his sad companions place,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bones of their loved comrade and laid them within a golden urn in</p>
    <p class=l>with tears collected, in the golden vase.<br />the sacred relics to the tent they bore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two layers of fat: they then covered the urn with a linen cloth<br />and took it inside the tent.</p>
    <p class=l>the urn a veil of linen covered o’er.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they marked off the circle where the</p>
    <p class=l>that done, they bid the sepulchre aspire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>barrow should be, made a foundation for it about the pyre, and</p>
    <p class=l>and cast the deep foundations round the pyre;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forthwith heaped up the earth.</p>
    <p class=l>high in the midst they heap the swelling bed<br />of rising earth, memorial of the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they had thus raised a mound<br />they were going away, but achilles stayed the people and made</p>
    <p class=l>the swarming populace the chief detains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them sit in assembly.</p>
    <p class=l>and leads amidst a wide extent of plains;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he brought prizes from the ships—cauldrons,</p>
    <p class=l>there placed them round: then from the ships proceeds</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tripods, horses and mules, noble oxen, women with fair girdles,</p>
    <p class=l>a train of oxen, mules, and stately steeds,<br />vases and tripods (for the funeral games),</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and swart iron.</p>
    <p class=l>resplendent brass, and more resplendent dames.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the first prize he offered was for the chariot races—a woman</p>
    <p class=l>first stood the prizes to reward the force<br />of rapid racers in the dusty course:<br />a woman for the first, in beauty’s bloom,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>skilled in all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that had</p>
    <p class=l>skill’d in the needle, and the labouring loom;<br />and a large vase, where two bright handles rise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ears for handles, and would hold twenty-two measures.</p>
    <p class=l>of twenty measures its capacious size.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this was<br />for the man who came in first.<br />for the second there was a<br />six-year old mare, unbroken, and in foal to a he-ass; the third</p>
    <p class=l>the second victor claims a mare unbroke,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was to have a goodly cauldron that had never yet been on the</p>
    <p class=l>big with a mule, unknowing of the yoke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fire; it was still bright as when it left the maker, and would</p>
    <p class=l>the third, a charger yet untouch’d by flame;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hold four measures.</p>
    <p class=l>four ample measures held the shining frame:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fourth prize was two talents of gold, and</p>
    <p class=l>two golden talents for the fourth were placed:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the fifth a two-handled urn as yet unsoiled by smoke.</p>
    <p class=l>an ample double bowl contents the last.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he</p>
    <p class=l>these in fair order ranged upon the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stood up and spoke among the argives saying—</p>
    <p class=l>the hero, rising, thus address’d the train:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“son of atreus, and all other achaeans, these are the prizes that<br />lie waiting the winners of the chariot races.</p>
    <p class=l>“behold the prizes, valiant greeks!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at any other time i</p>
    <p class=l>decreed</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should carry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; you</p>
    <p class=l>to the brave rulers of the racing steed;<br />prizes which none beside ourself could gain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>know how far my steeds excel all others—for they are immortal;</p>
    <p class=l>should our immortal coursers take the plain;<br />(a race unrivall’d, which from ocean’s god</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neptune gave them to my father peleus, who in his turn gave them</p>
    <p class=l>peleus received, and on his son bestow’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to myself; but i shall hold aloof, i and my steeds that have lost</p>
    <p class=l>)<br />but this no time our vigour to display;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their brave and kind driver, who many a time has washed them in</p>
    <p class=l>nor suit, with them, the games of this sad day:<br />lost is patroclus now, that wont to deck</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>clear water and anointed their manes with oil.</p>
    <p class=l>their flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see how they stand<br />weeping here, with their manes trailing on the ground in the</p>
    <p class=l>sad, as they shared in human grief, they stand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>extremity of their sorrow.</p>
    <p class=l>and trail those graceful honours on the sand!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but do you others set yourselves in</p>
    <p class=l>let others for the noble task prepare,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>order throughout the host, whosoever has confidence in his horses<br />and in the strength of his chariot.</p>
    <p class=l>who trust the courser and the flying car.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus spoke the son of peleus and the drivers of chariots<br />bestirred themselves.</p>
    <p class=l>fired at his word the rival racers rise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first among them all uprose eumelus, king</p>
    <p class=l>but far the first eumelus hopes the prize,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of men, son of admetus, a man excellent in horsemanship.</p>
    <p class=l>famed though pieria for the fleetest breed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>next to</p>
    <p class=l>and skill’d to manage the high-bounding steed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him rose mighty diomed son of tydeus; he yoked the trojan horses</p>
    <p class=l>with equal ardour bold tydides swell’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which he had taken from aeneas, when apollo bore him out of the</p>
    <p class=l>the steeds of tros beneath his yoke compell’d<br />(which late obey’d the dardan chief’s command,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fight.</p>
    <p class=l>when scarce a god redeem’d him from his hand).</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>next to him, yellow-haired menelaus son of atreus rose and</p>
    <p class=l>then menelaus his podargus brings,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yoked his fleet horses, agamemnon’s mare aethe, and his own horse</p>
    <p class=l>and the famed courser of the king of kings:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>podargus.</p>
    <p class=l>whom rich echepolus (more rich than brave),</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the mare had been given to agamemnon by echepolus son<br />of anchises, that he might not have to follow him to ilius, but</p>
    <p class=l>to ’scape the wars, to agamemnon gave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>might stay at home and take his ease; for jove had endowed him</p>
    <p class=l>(æthe her name) at home to end his days;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with great wealth and he lived in spacious sicyon.</p>
    <p class=l>base wealth preferring to eternal praise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this mare, all<br />eager for the race, did menelaus put under the yoke.<br />fourth in order antilochus, son to noble nestor son of neleus,</p>
    <p class=l>next him antilochus demands the course</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>made ready his horses.</p>
    <p class=l>with beating heart, and cheers his pylian horse.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these were bred in pylos, and his father</p>
    <p class=l>experienced nestor gives his son the reins,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came up to him to give him good advice of which, however, he</p>
    <p class=l>directs his judgment, and his heat restrains;<br />nor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stood in but little need.</p>
    <p class=l>the prudent son with unattending ears.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“antilochus,” said nestor, “you are</p>
    <p class=l>“my son!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>young, but jove and neptune have loved you well, and have made</p>
    <p class=l>though youthful ardour fire thy breast,<br />the gods have loved thee, and with arts have bless’d;<br />neptune and jove on thee conferr’d the skill</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you an excellent horseman.</p>
    <p class=l>swift round the goal to turn the flying wheel.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i need not therefore say much by way<br />of instruction.<br />you are skilful at wheeling your horses round the</p>
    <p class=l>to guide thy conduct little precept needs;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>post, but the horses themselves are very slow, and it is this</p>
    <p class=l>but slow, and past their vigour, are my steeds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that will, i fear, mar your chances.<br />the other drivers know less</p>
    <p class=l>fear not thy rivals, though for swiftness known;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>than you do, but their horses are fleeter; therefore, my dear</p>
    <p class=l>compare those rivals’ judgment and thy own:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son, see if you cannot hit upon some artifice whereby you may<br />insure that the prize shall not slip through your fingers.</p>
    <p class=l>it is not strength, but art, obtains the prize,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>and to be swift is less than to be wise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>woodman does more by skill than by brute force; by skill the</p>
    <p class=l>’tis more by art than force of numerous strokes<br />the dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pilot guides his storm-tossed barque over the sea, and so by</p>
    <p class=l>by art the pilot, through the boiling deep<br />and howling tempest, steers the fearless ship;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>skill one driver can beat another.</p>
    <p class=l>and ’tis the artist wins the glorious course;<br />not those who trust in chariots and in horse.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if a man go wide in rounding</p>
    <p class=l>in vain, unskilful to the goal they strive,<br />and short, or wide, the ungovern’d courser drive:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this way and that, whereas a man who knows what he is doing may<br />have worse horses, but he will keep them well in hand when he</p>
    <p class=l>while with sure skill, though with inferior steeds,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sees the doubling-post; he knows the precise moment at which to</p>
    <p class=l>the knowing racer to his end proceeds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pull the rein, and keeps his eye well on the man in front of him.</p>
    <p class=l>fix’d on the goal his eye foreruns the course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will give you this certain token which cannot escape your</p>
    <p class=l>his hand unerring steers the steady horse,<br />and now contracts, or now extends the rein,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>notice.</p>
    <p class=l>observing still the foremost on the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there is a stump of a dead tree—oak or pine as it may</p>
    <p class=l>mark then the goal, ’tis easy to be found;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be—some six feet above the ground, and not yet rotted away by</p>
    <p class=l>yon aged trunk, a cubit from the ground;<br />of some once stately oak the last remains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rain; it stands at the fork of the road; it has two white stones</p>
    <p class=l>or hardy fir, unperish’d with the rains:<br />inclosed with stones, conspicuous from afar;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>set one on each side, and there is a clear course all round it.</p>
    <p class=l>and round, a circle for the wheeling car.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it may have been a monument to some one long since dead, or it</p>
    <p class=l>(some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may have been used as a doubling-post in days gone by; now,</p>
    <p class=l>or then, as now, the limit of a race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>however, it has been fixed on by achilles as the mark round which</p>
    <p class=l>)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the chariots shall turn; hug it as close as you can, but as you</p>
    <p class=l>bear close to this, and warily proceed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stand in your chariot lean over a little to the left; urge on</p>
    <p class=l>a little bending to the left-hand steed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your right-hand horse with voice and lash, and give him a loose</p>
    <p class=l>but urge the right, and give him all the reins;<br />while thy strict hand his fellow’s head restrains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rein, but let the left-hand horse keep so close in, that the nave</p>
    <p class=l>and turns him short; till, doubling as they roll,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of your wheel shall almost graze the post; but mind the stone, or</p>
    <p class=l>the wheel’s round naves appear to brush the goal.<br />yet (not to break the car, or lame the horse)<br />clear of the stony heap direct the course;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you will wound your horses and break your chariot in pieces,</p>
    <p class=l>lest through incaution failing, thou mayst be</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which would be sport for others but confusion for yourself.</p>
    <p class=l>a joy to others, a reproach to me.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, my dear son, mind well what you are about, for if you</p>
    <p class=l>so shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>can be first to round the post there is no chance of any one</p>
    <p class=l>and leave unskilful swiftness far behind:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>giving you the go-by later, not even though you had adrestus’s</p>
    <p class=l>though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horse arion behind you—a horse which is of divine race—or those</p>
    <p class=l>which bore adrastus, of celestial breed;<br />or the famed race, through all the regions known,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of laomedon, which are the noblest in this country.</p>
    <p class=l>that whirl’d the car of proud laomedon.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when nestor had made an end of counselling his son he sat down in</p>
    <p class=l>thus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage<br />concludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his place, and fifth in order meriones got ready his horses.</p>
    <p class=l>next bold meriones was seen to rise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they</p>
    <p class=l>the last, but not least ardent for the prize.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then all mounted their chariots and cast lots.</p>
    <p class=l>they mount their seats; the lots their place dispose</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles shook the</p>
    <p class=l>(roll’d in his helmet, these achilles throws).</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>helmet, and the lot of antilochus son of nestor fell out first;</p>
    <p class=l>young nestor leads the race: eumelus then;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>next came that of king eumelus, and after his, those of menelaus</p>
    <p class=l>and next the brother of the king of men:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of atreus and of meriones.</p>
    <p class=l>thy lot, meriones, the fourth was cast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the last place fell to the lot of<br />diomed son of tydeus, who was the best man of them all.</p>
    <p class=l>and, far the bravest, diomed, was last.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they took</p>
    <p class=l>they stand in order, an impatient train:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their places in line; achilles showed them the doubling-post<br />round which they were to turn, some way off upon the plain; here</p>
    <p class=l>pelides points the barrier on the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he stationed his father’s follower phoenix as umpire, to note the</p>
    <p class=l>and sends before old phœnix to the place,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>running, and report truly.</p>
    <p class=l>to mark the racers, and to judge the race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struck</p>
    <p class=l>at once the coursers from the barrier bound;<br />the lifted scourges all at once resound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them with the reins, and shouted at them with all their might.</p>
    <p class=l>their heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they flew full speed over the plain away from the ships, the dust</p>
    <p class=l>and up the champaign thunder from the shore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rose from under them as it were a cloud or whirlwind, and their</p>
    <p class=l>thick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>manes were all flying in the wind.</p>
    <p class=l>and the lost courser in the whirlwind flies;<br />loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,<br />float in their speed, and dance upon the wind:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at one moment the chariots</p>
    <p class=l>the smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seemed to touch the ground, and then again they bounded into the</p>
    <p class=l>now seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>air; the drivers stood erect, and their hearts beat fast and<br />furious in their lust of victory.</p>
    <p class=l>while hot for fame, and conquest all their care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>each kept calling on his</p>
    <p class=l>(each o’er his flying courser hung in air,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses, and the horses scoured the plain amid the clouds of dust</p>
    <p class=l>erect with ardour, poised upon the rein,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that they raised.</p>
    <p class=l>they pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it was when they were doing the last part of the course on their<br />way back towards the sea that their pace was strained to the</p>
    <p class=l>now (the last compass fetch’d around the goal)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>utmost and it was seen what each could do.</p>
    <p class=l>at the near prize each gathers all his soul,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the horses of the</p>
    <p class=l>each burns with double hope, with double pain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>descendant of pheres now took the lead, and close behind them</p>
    <p class=l>tears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came the trojan stallions of diomed.</p>
    <p class=l>first flew eumelus on pheretian steeds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they seemed as if about to</p>
    <p class=l>with those of tros bold diomed succeeds:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mount eumelus’s chariot, and he could feel their warm breath on</p>
    <p class=l>close on eumelus’ back they puff the wind,<br />and seem just mounting on his car behind;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his back and on his broad shoulders, for their heads were close</p>
    <p class=l>full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to him as they flew over the course.</p>
    <p class=l>and, hovering o’er, their stretching shadows sees.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed would have now passed<br />him, or there would have been a dead heat, but phoebus apollo to<br />spite him made him drop his whip.</p>
    <p class=l>then had he lost, or left a doubtful prize;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tears of anger fell from his</p>
    <p class=l>but angry phœbus to tydides flies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eyes as he saw the mares going on faster than ever, while his own</p>
    <p class=l>strikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses lost ground through his having no whip.</p>
    <p class=l>his matchless horses’ labour on the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva saw the</p>
    <p class=l>rage fills his eye with anguish, to survey</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>trick which apollo had played the son of tydeus, so she brought</p>
    <p class=l>snatch’d from his hope the glories of the day.<br />the fraud celestial pallas sees with pain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him his whip and put spirit into his horses; moreover she went<br />after the son of admetus in a rage and broke his yoke for him;<br />the mares went one to one side of the course, and the other to</p>
    <p class=l>springs to her knight, and gives the scourge again,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the other, and the pole was broken against the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>and fills his steeds with vigour.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eumelus</p>
    <p class=l>at a stroke</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was thrown from his chariot close to the wheel; his elbows,</p>
    <p class=l>she breaks his rival’s chariot from the yoke:<br />no more their way the startled horses held;<br />the car reversed came rattling on the field;<br />shot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,<br />prone on the dust the unhappy master fell;<br />his batter’d face and elbows strike the ground;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mouth, and nostrils were all torn, and his forehead was bruised</p>
    <p class=l>nose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish’d wound:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>above his eyebrows; his eyes filled with tears and he could find<br />no utterance.</p>
    <p class=l>grief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but the son of tydeus turned his horses aside and</p>
    <p class=l>before him far the glad tydides flies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shot far ahead, for minerva put fresh strength into them and</p>
    <p class=l>minerva’s spirit drives his matchless pace,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>covered diomed himself with glory.</p>
    <p class=l>and crowns him victor of the labour’d race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus son of atreus came next behind him, but antilochus</p>
    <p class=l>the next, though distant, menelaus succeeds;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>called to his father’s horses.</p>
    <p class=l>while thus young nestor animates his steeds:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“on with you both,” he cried, “and<br />do your very utmost.</p>
    <p class=l>“now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i do not bid you try to beat the steeds of</p>
    <p class=l>not that we hope to match tydides’ horse,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of tydeus, for minerva has put running into them, and has</p>
    <p class=l>since great minerva wings their rapid way,<br />and gives their lord the honours of the day;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>covered diomed with glory; but you must overtake the horses of</p>
    <p class=l>but reach atrides!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of atreus and not be left behind, or aethe who is so<br />fleet will taunt you.</p>
    <p class=l>shall his mare outgo</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>why, my good fellows, are you lagging?</p>
    <p class=l>your swiftness?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i</p>
    <p class=l>vanquish’d by a female foe?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tell you, and it shall surely be—nestor will keep neither of you,</p>
    <p class=l>through your neglect, if lagging on the plain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but will put both of you to the sword, if we win any the worse a</p>
    <p class=l>the last ignoble gift be all we gain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>prize through your carelessness.</p>
    <p class=l>no more shall nestor’s hand your food supply,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fly after them at your utmost</p>
    <p class=l>the old man’s fury rises, and ye die.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>speed; i will hit on a plan for passing them in a narrow part of</p>
    <p class=l>haste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the way, and it shall not fail me.</p>
    <p class=l>presents the occasion, could we use it right.</p>

    <p class=l>”<br />thus he.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space</p>
    <p class=l>the coursers at their master’s threat</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went quicker.</p>
    <p class=l>with quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>presently antilochus saw a narrow place where the</p>
    <p class=l>and now antilochus with nice survey<br />observes the compass of the hollow way.<br />’twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>road had sunk.<br />the ground was broken, for the winter’s rain had</p>
    <p class=l>fast by the road a precipice was worn:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gathered and had worn the road so that the whole place was</p>
    <p class=l>here, where but one could pass, to shun the throng</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>deepened.</p>
    <p class=l>the spartan hero’s chariot smoked along.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus was making towards it so as to get there</p>
    <p class=l>close up the venturous youth resolves to keep,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first, for fear of a foul, but antilochus turned his horses out<br />of the way, and followed him a little on one side.</p>
    <p class=l>still edging near, and bears him toward the steep.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of</p>
    <p class=l>atrides, trembling, casts his eye below,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus was afraid and shouted out, “antilochus, you are driving</p>
    <p class=l>and wonders at the rashness of his foe.<br />“hold, stay your steeds—what madness thus to ride</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>recklessly; rein in your horses; the road is too narrow here, it</p>
    <p class=l>this narrow way!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will be wider soon, and you can pass me then; if you foul my</p>
    <p class=l>take larger field (he cried),</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariot you may bring both of us to a mischief.</p>
    <p class=l>or both must fall.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”—atrides cried in vain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he had</p>
    <p class=l>he flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not heard him.</p>
    <p class=l>far as an able arm the disk can send,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they went side by side for about as far as a young</p>
    <p class=l>when youthful rivals their full force extend,<br />so far, antilochus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>man can hurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying his</p>
    <p class=l>thy chariot flew</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strength, and then menelaus’s mares drew behind, for he left off</p>
    <p class=l>before the king: he, cautious, backward drew</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>driving for fear the horses should foul one another and upset the</p>
    <p class=l>his horse compell’d; foreboding in his fears</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariots; thus, while pressing on in quest of victory, they might</p>
    <p class=l>the rattling ruin of the clashing cars,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>both come headlong to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>the floundering coursers rolling on the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus then upbraided</p>
    <p class=l>and conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>antilochus and said, “there is no greater trickster living than</p>
    <p class=l>but thus upbraids his rival as he flies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you are; go, and bad luck go with you; the achaeans say not well</p>
    <p class=l>“go, furious youth!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that you have understanding, and come what may you shall not bear</p>
    <p class=l>ungenerous and unwise!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>away the prize without sworn protest on my part.</p>
    <p class=l>go, but expect not i’ll the prize resign;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>add perjury to fraud, and make it thine—”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he called on his horses and said to them, “keep your pace,</p>
    <p class=l>then to his steeds with all his force he cries,<br />“be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and slacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary sooner</p>
    <p class=l>your rivals, destitute of youthful force,<br />with fainting knees shall labour in the course,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>than yours, for they are neither of them young.</p>
    <p class=l>and yield the glory yours.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”—the steeds obey;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, so</p>
    <p class=l>already at their heels they wing their way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that they were soon nearly up with the others.</p>
    <p class=l>and seem already to retrieve the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meanwhile the achaeans from their seats were watching how the</p>
    <p class=l>meantime the grecians in a ring beheld</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses went, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their own<br />dust.</p>
    <p class=l>the coursers bounding o’er the dusty field.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus captain of the cretans was first to make out the</p>
    <p class=l>the first who mark’d them was the cretan king;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>running, for he was not in the thick of the crowd, but stood on</p>
    <p class=l>high on a rising ground, above the ring,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the most commanding part of the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>the monarch sat: from whence with sure survey</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the driver was a long way</p>
    <p class=l>he well observed the chief who led the way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>off, but idomeneus could hear him shouting, and could see the</p>
    <p class=l>and heard from far his animating cries,<br />and saw the foremost steed with sharpen’d eyes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foremost horse quite plainly—a chestnut with a round white star,</p>
    <p class=l>on whose broad front a blaze of shining white,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like the moon, on its forehead.</p>
    <p class=l>like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he stood up and said among the</p>
    <p class=l>he saw; and rising, to the greeks begun:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>argives, “my friends, princes and counsellors of the argives, can<br />you see the running as well as i can?</p>
    <p class=l>“are yonder horse discern’d by me alone?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there seems to be another</p>
    <p class=l>or can ye, all, another chief survey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pair in front now, and another driver; those that led off at the</p>
    <p class=l>and other steeds than lately led the way?<br />those, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>start must have been disabled out on the plain.</p>
    <p class=l>lie sure disabled in the middle field:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i saw them at<br />first making their way round the doubling-post, but now, though i</p>
    <p class=l>for, since the goal they doubled, round the plain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>search the plain of troy, i cannot find them.</p>
    <p class=l>i search to find them, but i search in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>perhaps the reins<br />fell from the driver’s hand so that he lost command of his horses</p>
    <p class=l>perchance the reins forsook the driver’s hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at the doubling-post, and could not turn it.<br />i suppose he must</p>
    <p class=l>and, turn’d too short, he tumbled on the strand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have been thrown out there, and broken his chariot, while his</p>
    <p class=l>shot from the chariot; while his coursers stray</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mares have left the course and gone off wildly in a panic.</p>
    <p class=l>with frantic fury from the destined way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come</p>
    <p class=l>rise then some other, and inform my sight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>up and see for yourselves, i cannot make out for certain, but the</p>
    <p class=l>for these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>driver seems an aetolian by descent, ruler over the argives,</p>
    <p class=l>yet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brave diomed the son of tydeus.</p>
    <p class=l>the great ætolian chief, renown’d in war.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax the son of oileus took him up rudely and said, “idomeneus,</p>
    <p class=l>“old man!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>why should you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, when</p>
    <p class=l>(oïleus rashly thus replies)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the mares are still so far out upon the plain?</p>
    <p class=l>thy tongue too hastily confers the prize;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you are none of</p>
    <p class=l>of those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the youngest, nor your eyes none of the sharpest, but you are</p>
    <p class=l>nor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>always laying down the law.</p>
    <p class=l>eumelus’ steeds, high bounding in the chase,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you have no right to do so, for there</p>
    <p class=l>still, as at first, unrivall’d lead the race:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are better men here than you are.<br />eumelus’s horses are in front</p>
    <p class=l>i well discern him, as he shakes the rein,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, as they always have been, and he is on the chariot holding</p>
    <p class=l>and hear his shouts victorious o’er the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the reins.</p>
    <p class=l>”<br />thus he.<br />idomeneus, incensed, rejoin’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>“barbarous of words!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the captain of the cretans was angry, and answered, “ajax you are</p>
    <p class=l>and arrogant of mind!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>an excellent railer, but you have no judgement, and are wanting</p>
    <p class=l>contentious prince, of all the greeks beside</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in much else as well, for you have a vile temper.</p>
    <p class=l>the last in merit, as the first in pride!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will wager</p>
    <p class=l>to vile reproach what answer can we make?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you a tripod or cauldron, and agamemnon son of atreus shall</p>
    <p class=l>a goblet or a tripod let us stake,<br />and be the king the judge.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>decide whose horses are first.</p>
    <p class=l>the most unwise</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you will then know to your cost.</p>
    <p class=l>will learn their rashness, when they pay the price.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax son of oileus was for making him an angry answer, and there</p>
    <p class=l>he said: and ajax, by mad passion borne,<br />stern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would have been yet further brawling between them, had not</p>
    <p class=l>to fell extremes.<br />but thetis’ godlike son<br />awful amidst them rose, and thus begun:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles risen in his place and said, “cease your railing, ajax</p>
    <p class=l>“forbear, ye chiefs!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and idomeneus; it is not seemly; you would be scandalised if you</p>
    <p class=l>reproachful to contend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saw any one else do the like: sit down and keep your eyes on the<br />horses; they are speeding towards the winning-post and will be</p>
    <p class=l>much would ye blame, should others thus offend:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>here directly.</p>
    <p class=l>and lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you will then both of you know whose horses are<br />first, and whose come after.</p>
    <p class=l>the approaching steeds your contest end.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he was speaking, the son of tydeus came driving in, plying his</p>
    <p class=l>no sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,<br />drives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whip lustily from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as</p>
    <p class=l>high o’er his head the circling lash he wields:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they flew over the course.</p>
    <p class=l>his bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the sand and grit rained thick on the</p>
    <p class=l>his car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>driver, and the chariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind</p>
    <p class=l>bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his fleet horses.</p>
    <p class=l>refulgent through the cloud: no eye could find</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there was little trace of wheel-marks in the</p>
    <p class=l>the track his flying wheels had left behind:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fine dust, and the horses came flying in at their utmost speed.</p>
    <p class=l>and the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace<br />so swift, it seem’d a flight, and not a race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed stayed them in the middle of the crowd, and the sweat from</p>
    <p class=l>now victor at the goal tydides stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their manes and chests fell in streams on to the ground.</p>
    <p class=l>quits his bright car, and springs upon the sands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forthwith he sprang from his goodly chariot, and leaned his whip</p>
    <p class=l>from the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>against his horses’ yoke; brave sthenelus now lost no time, but</p>
    <p class=l>the well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at once brought on the prize, and gave the woman and the</p>
    <p class=l>with joy brave sthenelus receives the prize,<br />the tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ear-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away.</p>
    <p class=l>these to the ships his train triumphant leads,<br />the chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he</p>
    <p class=l>young nestor follows (who by art, not force,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>unyoked the horses.</p>
    <p class=l>o’erpass’d atrides) second in the course.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>next after him came in antilochus of the race of neleus, who had</p>
    <p class=l>behind, atrides urged the race, more near</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>passed menelaus by a trick and not by the fleetness of his</p>
    <p class=l>than to the courser in his swift career</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses; but even so menelaus came in as close behind him as the</p>
    <p class=l>the following car, just touching with his heel</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wheel is to the horse that draws both the chariot and its master.<br />the end hairs of a horse’s tail touch the tyre of the wheel, and</p>
    <p class=l>and brushing with his tail the whirling wheel:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there is never much space between wheel and horse when the</p>
    <p class=l>such, and so narrow now the space between</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariot is going; menelaus was no further than this behind</p>
    <p class=l>the rivals, late so distant on the green;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>antilochus, though at first he had been a full disc’s throw</p>
    <p class=l>so soon swift æthe her lost ground regain’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>behind him.</p>
    <p class=l>one length, one moment, had the race obtain’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he had soon caught him up again, for agamemnon’s mare<br />aethe kept pulling stronger and stronger, so that if the course<br />had been longer he would have passed him, and there would not<br />even have been a dead heat.<br />idomeneus’s brave squire meriones was<br />about a spear’s cast behind menelaus.<br />his horses were slowest of</p>
    <p class=l>merion pursued, at greater distance still,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all, and he was the worst driver.</p>
    <p class=l>with tardier coursers, and inferior skill.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>last of them all came the son</p>
    <p class=l>last came, admetus!<br />thy unhappy son;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of admetus, dragging his chariot and driving his horses on in</p>
    <p class=l>slow dragged the steeds his batter’d chariot on:<br />achilles saw, and pitying thus begun:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>front.</p>
    <p class=l>“behold!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when achilles saw him he was sorry, and stood up among the</p>
    <p class=l>the man whose matchless art surpass’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>argives saying, “the best man is coming in last.</p>
    <p class=l>the sons of greece!<br />the ablest, yet the last!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us give him<br />a prize for it is reasonable.<br />he shall have the second, but the</p>
    <p class=l>fortune denies, but justice bids us pay</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first must go to the son of tydeus.</p>
    <p class=l>(since great tydides bears the first away)<br />to him the second honours of the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his</p>
    <p class=l>the greeks consent with loud-applauding cries,<br />and then eumelus had received the prize,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saying, and were for doing as he had said, but nestor’s son</p>
    <p class=l>but youthful nestor, jealous of his fame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>antilochus stood up and claimed his rights from the son of</p>
    <p class=l>the award opposes, and asserts his claim.<br />“think not (he cries) i tamely will resign,</p>

    <p class=r>peleus.</p>
    <p class=l>o peleus’ son!</p>

    <p class=r>“achilles,” said he, “i shall take it much amiss if you</p>
    <p class=l>the mare so justly mine.</p>

    <p class=r>do this thing; you would rob me of my prize, because you think</p>
    <p class=l>what if the gods, the skilful to confound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eumelus’s chariot and horses were thrown out, and himself too,</p>

    <p class=r>achilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with</p>
    <p class=l>thus spake the youth; nor did his words offend;<br />pleased with the well-turn’d flattery of a friend,<br />achilles smiled: “the gift proposed (he cried),</p>

    <p class=r>antilochus, who was one of his dearest comrades.</p>
    <p class=l>antilochus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so he said—</p>
    <p class=l>we shall ourself provide.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“antilochus, if you would have me find eumelus another prize, i</p>
    <p class=l>with plates of brass the corslet cover’d o’er,<br />(the same renown’d asteropaeus wore,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will give him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running</p>
    <p class=l>whose glittering margins raised with silver shine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all round it which i took from asteropaeus.</p>
    <p class=l>(no vulgar gift,) eumelus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it will be worth much<br />money to him.</p>
    <p class=l>shall be thine.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he bade his comrade automedon bring the breastplate from his</p>
    <p class=l>he said: automedon at his command</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>tent, and he did so.</p>
    <p class=l>the corslet brought, and gave it to his hand.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles then gave it over to eumelus, who</p>
    <p class=l>distinguish’d by his friend, his bosom glows</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>received it gladly.<br />but menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with antilochus.</p>
    <p class=l>with generous joy: then menelaus rose;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>an attendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the argives</p>
    <p class=l>the herald placed the sceptre in his hands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>keep silence: the hero then addressed them.</p>
    <p class=l>and still’d the clamour of the shouting bands.<br />not without cause incensed at nestor’s son,<br />and inly grieving, thus the king begun:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“antilochus,” said</p>
    <p class=l>“the praise of wisdom, in thy youth obtain’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he, “what is this from you who have been so far blameless?</p>
    <p class=l>an act so rash, antilochus!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you</p>
    <p class=l>has stain’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have made me cut a poor figure and baulked my horses by flinging</p>
    <p class=l>robb’d of my glory and my just reward,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your own in front of them, though yours are much worse than mine</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are; therefore, o princes and counsellors of the argives, judge</p>
    <p class=l>be my wrong declared:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>between us and show no favour, lest one of the achaeans say,</p>
    <p class=l>so not a leader shall our conduct blame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>‘menelaus has got the mare through lying and corruption; his</p>
    <p class=l>or judge me envious of a rival’s fame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>horses were far inferior to antilochus’s, but he has greater</p>
    <p class=l>but shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>weight and influence.</p>
    <p class=l>what needs appealing in a fact so plain?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>’ nay, i will determine the matter myself,<br />and no man will blame me, for i shall do what is just.</p>
    <p class=l>what greek shall blame me, if i bid thee rise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>come here,</p>
    <p class=l>and vindicate by oath th’ ill-gotten prize?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>antilochus, and stand, as our custom is, whip in hand before your</p>
    <p class=l>rise if thou darest, before thy chariot stand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>chariot and horses; lay your hand on your steeds, and swear by</p>
    <p class=l>the driving scourge high-lifted in thy hand;<br />and touch thy steeds, and swear thy whole intent</p>

    <p class=r>guilefully get in the way of my horses.</p>
    <p class=l>the globe, and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and antilochus answered, “forgive me; i am much younger, king</p>
    <p class=l>the prudent chief with calm attention heard;<br />then mildly thus: “excuse, if youth have err’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus, than you are; you stand higher than i do and are the</p>
    <p class=l>superior as thou art, forgive the offence,<br />nor i thy equal, or in years, or sense.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>better man of the two; you know how easily young men are betrayed</p>
    <p class=l>thou know’st the errors of unripen’d age,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into indiscretion; their tempers are more hasty and they have</p>
    <p class=l>weak are its counsels, headlong is its rage.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>less judgement; make due allowances therefore, and bear with me;<br />i will of my own accord give up the mare that i have won, and if</p>
    <p class=l>the prize i quit, if thou thy wrath resign;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you claim any further chattel from my own possessions, i would</p>
    <p class=l>the mare, or aught thou ask’st, be freely thine</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rather yield it to you, at once, than fall from your good graces</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of nestor then took the mare and gave her over to</p>
    <p class=l>so spoke antilochus; and at the word<br />the mare contested to the king restored.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>menelaus, whose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon a</p>
    <p class=l>joy swells his soul: as when the vernal grain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>field of ripening corn, and the lands are bristling with the</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>harvest—even so, o menelaus, was your heart made glad within you.</p>
    <p class=l>such joy the spartan’s shining face o’erspread,<br />and lifted his gay heart, while thus he said:<br />“still may our souls, o generous youth!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he turned to antilochus and said, “now, antilochus, angry though</p>
    <p class=l>agree<br />’tis now atrides’ turn to yield to thee.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i have been, i can give way to you of my own free will; you have</p>
    <p class=l>rash heat perhaps a moment might control,</p>

    <p class=r>never been headstrong nor ill-disposed hitherto, but this time</p>
    <p class=l>not break, the settled temper of thy soul.<br />not but (my friend) ’tis still the wiser way</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your youth has got the better of your judgement; be careful how</p>
    <p class=l>to waive contention with superior sway;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you outwit your betters in future; no one else could have brought</p>
    <p class=l>for ah!<br />how few, who should like thee offend,<br />like thee, have talents to regain the friend!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me round so easily, but your good father, your brother, and</p>
    <p class=l>to plead indulgence, and thy fault atone,<br />suffice thy father’s merit and thy own:<br />generous alike, for me, the sire and son</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yourself have all of you had infinite trouble on my behalf; i</p>
    <p class=l>have greatly suffer’d, and have greatly done.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore yield to your entreaty, and will give up the mare to<br />you, mine though it indeed be; the people will thus see that i am</p>
    <p class=l>i yield; that all may know, my soul can bend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neither harsh nor vindictive.</p>
    <p class=l>nor is my pride preferr’d before my friend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this he gave the mare over to antilochus’s comrade noemon,</p>
    <p class=l>he said; and pleased his passion to command,<br />resign’d the courser to noemon’s hand,<br />friend of the youthful chief: himself content,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and then took the cauldron.</p>
    <p class=l>the shining charger to his vessel sent.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones, who had come in fourth,</p>
    <p class=l>the golden talents merion next obtain’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>carried off the two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, the</p>
    <p class=l>the fifth reward, the double bowl, remain’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two-handled urn, being unawarded, achilles gave it to nestor,</p>
    <p class=l>achilles this to reverend nestor bears.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>going up to him among the assembled argives and saying, “take</p>
    <p class=l>and thus the purpose of his gift declares:<br />“accept thou this, o sacred sire!<br />(he said)</p>

    <p class=l>the quoit to toss, the ponderous mace to wield,<br />or urge the race, or wrestle on the field:<br />thy pristine vigour age has overthrown,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heavily upon you.</p>
    <p class=l>but left the glory of the past thy own.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so saying he gave the urn over to nestor, who received it gladly</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and placed the goblet at his side;<br />with joy the venerable king replied:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and answered, “my son, all that you have said is true; there is</p>
    <p class=l>“wisely and well, my son, thy words have proved<br />a senior honour’d, and a friend beloved!</p>

    <p class=r>no strength now in my legs and feet, nor can i hit out with my</p>

    <p class=l>these wither’d arms and limbs have fail’d at length.</p>

    <p class=r>buprasium, and his sons offered prizes in his honour.</p>

    <p class=r>there was</p>
    <p class=l>ordain’d to amarynces’ mighty name;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then none that could vie with me neither of the epeans nor the</p>
    <p class=l>the brave epeians gave my glory way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pylians themselves nor the aetolians.</p>
    <p class=l>ætolians, pylians, all resign’d the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in boxing i overcame<br />clytomedes son of enops, and in wrestling, ancaeus of pleuron who</p>
    <p class=l>i quell’d clytomedes in fights of hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had come forward against me.</p>
    <p class=l>and backward hurl’d ancæus on the sand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>iphiclus was a good runner, but i</p>
    <p class=l>surpass’d iphyclus in the swift career,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beat him, and threw farther with my spear than either phyleus or<br />polydorus.</p>
    <p class=l>phyleus and polydorus with the spear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in chariot-racing alone did the two sons of actor<br />surpass me by crowding their horses in front of me, for they were</p>
    <p class=l>the sons of actor won the prize of horse,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>angry at the way victory had gone, and at the greater part of the</p>
    <p class=l>but won by numbers, not by art or force:<br />for the famed twins, impatient to survey</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>prizes remaining in the place in which they had been offered.</p>
    <p class=l>prize after prize by nestor borne away,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were twins, and the one kept on holding the reins, and</p>
    <p class=l>sprung to their car; and with united pains</p>

    <p class=r>holding the reins, while the other plied the whip.</p>
    <p class=l>one lash’d the coursers, while one ruled the reins.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thereon the son of peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks</p>
    <p class=l>proud of the gift, thus spake the full of days:<br />achilles heard him, prouder of the praise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of nestor, went about among the concourse of the achaeans, and</p>
    <p class=l>the prizes next are order’d to the field,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>presently offered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing.</p>
    <p class=l>for the bold champions who the caestus wield.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he brought out a strong mule, and made it fast in the middle of</p>
    <p class=l>a stately mule, as yet by toils unbroke,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the crowd—a she-mule never yet broken, but six years old—when it</p>
    <p class=l>of six years’ age, unconscious of the yoke,</p>

    <p class=l>is to the circus led, and firmly bound;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the vanquished he offered a double cup.<br />then he stood up and said</p>
    <p class=l>next stands a goblet, massy, large, and round.</p>

    <p class=r>among the argives, “son of atreus, and all other achaeans, i</p>

    <p class=r>middle of the ring, and immediately fell to; heavily indeed did</p>
    <p class=l>and poises high in air his iron hands;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they punish one another and lay about them with their brawny</p>
    <p class=l>with clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fists.<br />one could hear the horrid crashing of their jaws, and they</p>
    <p class=l>their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sweated from every pore of their skin.</p>
    <p class=l>and painful sweat from all their members flows.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>presently epeus came on</p>
    <p class=l>at length epeus dealt a weighty blow</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and gave euryalus a blow on the jaw as he was looking round;</p>
    <p class=l>full on the cheek of his unwary foe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>euryalus could not keep his legs; they gave way under him in a</p>
    <p class=l>beneath that ponderous arm’s resistless sway</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>moment and he sprang up with a bound, as a fish leaps into the</p>
    <p class=l>down dropp’d he, nerveless, and extended lay.<br />as a large fish, when winds and waters roar,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>air near some shore that is all bestrewn with sea-wrack, when</p>
    <p class=l>by some huge billow dash’d against the shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>boreas furs the top of the waves, and then falls back into deep</p>
    <p class=l>lies panting; not less batter’d with his wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>water.</p>
    <p class=l>the bleeding hero pants upon the ground.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but noble epeus caught hold of him and raised him up; his</p>
    <p class=l>to rear his fallen foe, the victor lends,<br />scornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends;<br />whose arms support him, reeling through the throng,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>comrades also came round him and led him from the ring, unsteady</p>
    <p class=l>and dragging his disabled legs along;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in his gait, his head hanging on one side, and spitting great</p>
    <p class=l>nodding, his head hangs down his shoulder o’er;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>clots of gore.</p>
    <p class=l>his mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore;[292]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they set him down in a swoon and then went to</p>
    <p class=l>wrapp’d round in mists he lies, and lost to thought;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fetch the double cup.</p>
    <p class=l>his friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of peleus now brought out the prizes for the third</p>
    <p class=l>the third bold game achilles next demands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>contest and showed them to the argives.<br />these were for the<br />painful art of wrestling.</p>
    <p class=l>and calls the wrestlers to the level sands:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the winner there was a great tripod<br />ready for setting upon the fire, and the achaeans valued it among</p>
    <p class=l>a massy tripod for the victor lies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>themselves at twelve oxen.</p>
    <p class=l>of twice six oxen its reputed price;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the loser he brought out a woman</p>
    <p class=l>and next, the loser’s spirits to restore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>skilled in all manner of arts, and they valued her at four oxen.</p>
    <p class=l>a female captive, valued but at four.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he rose and said among the argives, “stand forward, you who will<br />essay this contest.</p>
    <p class=l>scarce did the chief the vigorous strife propose</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”<br />forthwith uprose great ajax the son of telamon, and crafty<br />ulysses, full of wiles, rose also.</p>
    <p class=l>when tower-like ajax and ulysses rose.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the two girded themselves and<br />went into the middle of the ring.<br />they gripped each other in</p>
    <p class=l>amid the ring each nervous rival stands,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their strong hands like the rafters which some master-builder</p>
    <p class=l>embracing rigid with implicit hands.<br />close lock’d above, their heads and arms are mix’d:<br />below, their planted feet at distance fix’d;<br />like two strong rafters which the builder forms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>frames for the roof of a high house to keep the wind out.</p>
    <p class=l>proof to the wintry winds and howling storms,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their</p>
    <p class=l>their tops connected, but at wider space</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>backbones cracked as they tugged at one another with their mighty</p>
    <p class=l>fix’d on the centre stands their solid base.<br />now to the grasp each manly body bends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>arms—and sweat rained from them in torrents.</p>
    <p class=l>the humid sweat from every pore descends;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many a bloody weal<br />sprang up on their sides and shoulders, but they kept on striving</p>
    <p class=l>their bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with might and main for victory and to win the tripod.</p>
    <p class=l>swell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses</p>
    <p class=l>nor could ulysses, for his art renown’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>could not throw ajax, nor ajax him; ulysses was too strong for</p>
    <p class=l>o’erturn the strength of ajax on the ground;<br />nor could the strength of ajax overthrow</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him; but when the achaeans began to tire of watching them, ajax</p>
    <p class=l>the watchful caution of his artful foe.<br />while the long strife even tired the lookers on,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said to ulysses, “ulysses, noble son of laertes, you shall either</p>
    <p class=l>thus to ulysses spoke great telamon:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lift me, or i you, and let jove settle it between us.</p>
    <p class=l>“or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me:<br />prove we our force, and jove the rest decree.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but ulysses did not</p>
    <p class=l>he said; and, straining, heaved him off the ground</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forget his cunning.</p>
    <p class=l>with matchless strength; that time ulysses found</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he hit ajax in the hollow at back of his</p>
    <p class=l>the strength to evade, and where the nerves combine</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>knee, so that he could not keep his feet, but fell on his back</p>
    <p class=l>his ankle struck: the giant fell supine;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with ulysses lying upon his chest, and all who saw it marvelled.</p>
    <p class=l>ulysses, following, on his bosom lies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then ulysses in turn lifted ajax and stirred him a little from</p>
    <p class=l>shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.<br />ajax to lift ulysses next essays;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ground but could not lift him right off it, his knee sank</p>
    <p class=l>he barely stirr’d him, but he could not raise:<br />his knee lock’d fast, the foe’s attempt denied;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>under him, and the two fell side by side on the ground and were</p>
    <p class=l>and grappling close, they tumbled side by side.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all begrimed with dust.</p>
    <p class=l>defiled with honourable dust they roll,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they now sprang towards one another and</p>
    <p class=l>still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were for wrestling yet a third time, but achilles rose and stayed</p>
    <p class=l>again they rage, again to combat rise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them.</p>
    <p class=l>when great achilles thus divides the prize:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“put not each other further,” said he, “to such cruel</p>
    <p class=l>“your noble vigour, o my friends, restrain;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>suffering; the victory is with both alike, take each of you an</p>
    <p class=l>nor weary out your generous strength in vain.<br />ye both have won: let others who excel,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>equal prize, and let the other achaeans now compete.</p>
    <p class=l>now prove that prowess you have proved so well.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on</p>
    <p class=l>the hero’s words the willing chiefs obey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their shirts again after wiping the dust from off their bodies.</p>
    <p class=l>from their tired bodies wipe the dust away,<br />and, clothed anew, the following games survey.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the son of peleus then offered prizes for speed in running—a</p>
    <p class=l>and now succeed the gifts ordain’d to grace<br />the youths contending in the rapid race:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mixing-bowl beautifully wrought, of pure silver.<br />it would hold<br />six measures, and far exceeded all others in the whole world for</p>
    <p class=l>a silver urn that full six measures held,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beauty; it was the work of cunning artificers in sidon, and had</p>
    <p class=l>by none in weight or workmanship excell’d:<br />sidonian artists taught the frame to shine,<br />elaborate, with artifice divine;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>been brought into port by phoenicians from beyond the sea, who</p>
    <p class=l>whence tyrian sailors did the prize transport,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had made a present of it to thoas.</p>
    <p class=l>and gave to thoas at the lemnian port:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eueneus son of jason had given</p>
    <p class=l>from him descended, good eunaeus heir’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it to patroclus in ransom of priam’s son lycaon, and achilles now</p>
    <p class=l>the glorious gift; and, for lycaon spared,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>offered it as a prize in honour of his comrade to him who should</p>
    <p class=l>to brave patroclus gave the rich reward:<br />now, the same hero’s funeral rites to grace,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>be the swiftest runner.</p>
    <p class=l>it stands the prize of swiftness in the race.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for the second prize he offered a large</p>
    <p class=l>a well-fed ox was for the second placed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ox, well fattened, while for the last there was to be half a<br />talent of gold.</p>
    <p class=l>and half a talent must content the last.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then rose and said among the argives, “stand</p>
    <p class=l>achilles rising then bespoke the train:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forward, you who will essay this contest.</p>
    <p class=l>“who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,<br />stand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forthwith uprose fleet ajax son of oileus, with cunning ulysses,</p>
    <p class=l>the hero said, and starting from his place,<br />oilean ajax rises to the race;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and nestor’s son antilochus, the fastest runner among all the</p>
    <p class=l>ulysses next; and he whose speed surpass’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>youth of his time.</p>
    <p class=l>his youthful equals, nestor’s son, the last.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they stood side by side and achilles showed</p>
    <p class=l>ranged in a line the ready racers stand;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them the goal.</p>
    <p class=l>pelides points the barrier with his hand;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the course was set out for them from the</p>
    <p class=l>all start at once; oïleus led the race;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>starting-post, and the son of oileus took the lead at once, with</p>
    <p class=l>the next ulysses, measuring pace with pace;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses as close behind him as the shuttle is to a woman’s bosom</p>
    <p class=l>behind him, diligently close, he sped,<br />as closely following as the running thread</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when she throws the woof across the warp and holds it close up to</p>
    <p class=l>the spindle follows, and displays the charms<br />of the fair spinster’s breast and moving arms:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her; even so close behind him was ulysses—treading in his</p>
    <p class=l>graceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>footprints before the dust could settle there, and ajax could</p>
    <p class=l>and treads each footstep ere the dust can rise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>feel his breath on the back of his head as he ran swiftly on.</p>
    <p class=l>his glowing breath upon his shoulders plays:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the</p>
    <p class=l>the admiring greeks loud acclamations raise:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans all shouted applause as they saw him straining his</p>
    <p class=l>to him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>utmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but when they were</p>
    <p class=l>and send their souls before him as he flies.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now nearing the end of the course ulysses prayed inwardly to</p>
    <p class=l>now three times turn’d in prospect of the goal,<br />the panting chief to pallas lifts his soul:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>minerva.<br />“hear me,” he cried, “and help my feet, o goddess.</p>
    <p class=l>“assist, o goddess!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>” thus</p>
    <p class=l>” thus in thought he pray’d!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>did he pray, and pallas minerva heard his prayer; she made his</p>
    <p class=l>and present at his thought descends the maid.<br />buoy’d by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hands and his feet feel light, and when the runners were at the</p>
    <p class=l>and feels a pinion lifting every limb.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>point of pouncing upon the prize, ajax, through minerva’s spite</p>
    <p class=l>all fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,<br />unhappy ajax stumbles on the plain</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>slipped upon some offal that was lying there from the cattle</p>
    <p class=l>(o’erturn’d by pallas), where the slippery shore</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which achilles had slaughtered in honour of patroclus, and his</p>
    <p class=l>was clogg’d with slimy dung and mingled gore.<br />(the self-same place beside patroclus’ pyre,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mouth and nostrils were all filled with cow dung.</p>
    <p class=l>where late the slaughter’d victims fed the fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ulysses</p>
    <p class=l>)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore carried off the mixing-bowl, for he got before ajax and</p>
    <p class=l>besmear’d with filth, and blotted o’er with clay,<br />obscene to sight, the rueful racer lay;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came in first.</p>
    <p class=l>the well-fed bull (the second prize) he shared,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but ajax took the ox and stood with his hand on</p>
    <p class=l>and left the urn ulysses’ rich reward.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one of its horns, spitting the dung out of his mouth.</p>
    <p class=l>then, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he</p>
    <p class=l>the baffled hero thus the greeks address’d:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>said to the argives, “alas, the goddess has spoiled my running;</p>
    <p class=l>“accursed fate!<br />the conquest i forego;<br />a mortal i, a goddess was my foe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she watches over ulysses and stands by him as though she were his</p>
    <p class=l>she urged her favourite on the rapid way,<br />and pallas, not ulysses, won the day.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>own mother.</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>” thus did he speak and they all of them laughed</p>
    <p class=l>thus sourly wail’d he, sputtering dirt and gore;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heartily.</p>
    <p class=l>a burst of laughter echoed through the shore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>antilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to</p>
    <p class=l>antilochus, more humorous than the rest,<br />takes the last prize, and takes it with a jest:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the bystanders, “you all see, my friends, that now too the gods</p>
    <p class=l>“why with our wiser elders should we strive?<br />the gods still love them, and they always thrive.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have shown their respect for seniority.</p>
    <p class=l>ye see, to ajax i must yield the prize:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax is somewhat older</p>
    <p class=l>he to ulysses, still more aged and wise;<br />(a green old age unconscious of decays,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>than i am, and as for ulysses, he belongs to an earlier</p>
    <p class=l>that proves the hero born in better days!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>generation, but he is hale in spite of his years, and no man of</p>
    <p class=l>)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans can run against him save only achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>behold his vigour in this active race!<br />achilles only boasts a swifter pace:<br />for who can match achilles?<br />he who can,<br />must yet be more than hero, more than man.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”<br />the effect succeeds the speech.<br />pelides cries,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he said this to pay a compliment to the son of peleus, and</p>
    <p class=l>“thy artful praise deserves a better prize.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles answered, “antilochus, you shall not have praised me to</p>
    <p class=l>nor greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>no purpose; i shall give you an additional half talent of gold.</p>
    <p class=l>receive a talent of the purest gold.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he then gave the half talent to antilochus, who received it</p>
    <p class=l>the youth departs content.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gladly.</p>
    <p class=l>the host admire</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then the son of peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield</p>
    <p class=l>the son of nestor, worthy of his sire.<br />next these a buckler, spear, and helm, he brings;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that had been borne by sarpedon, and were taken from him by</p>
    <p class=l>cast on the plain, the brazen burden rings:<br />arms which of late divine sarpedon wore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>patroclus.</p>
    <p class=l>and great patroclus in short triumph bore.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he stood up and said among the argives, “we bid two</p>
    <p class=l>“stand forth the bravest of our host!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>champions put on their armour, take their keen blades, and make</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a hearty meal in my own tent.</p>
    <p class=l>a sumptuous banquet at our tents attends.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forthwith uprose great ajax the son of telamon, as also mighty</p>
    <p class=l>fierce at the word uprose great tydeus’ son,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>diomed son of tydeus.</p>
    <p class=l>and the huge bulk of ajax telamon.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they had put on their armour each on</p>

    <p class=r>engage, and with fire flashing from their eyes.</p>
    <p class=l>louring they meet, tremendous to the sight;</p>

    <p class=r>the achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>each argive bosom beats with fierce delight.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>marvelled as they beheld them, and when the two were now close up</p>
    <p class=l>opposed in arms not long they idly stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with one another, thrice did they spring forward and thrice try</p>
    <p class=l>but thrice they closed, and thrice the charge renew’d.</p>

    <p class=r>to strike each other in close combat.<br />ajax pierced diomed’s round</p>

    <p class=l>not thus the foe: his javelin aim’d above</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>huge shield kept aiming continually at ajax’s neck with the point</p>
    <p class=l>the buckler’s margin, at the neck he drove.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of his spear, and the achaeans alarmed for his safety bade them</p>
    <p class=l>but greece, now trembling for her hero’s life,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>leave off fighting and divide the prize between them.</p>
    <p class=l>bade share the honours, and surcease the strife.</p>

    <p class=r>achilles</p>
    <p class=l>yet still the victor’s due tydides gains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then gave the great sword to the son of tydeus, with its<br />scabbard, and the leathern belt with which to hang it.</p>
    <p class=l>with him the sword and studded belt remains.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty eetion</p>
    <p class=l>then hurl’d the hero, thundering on the ground,<br />a mass of iron (an enormous round),<br />whose weight and size the circling greeks admire,<br />rude from the furnace, and but shaped by fire.<br />this mighty quoit aëtion wont to rear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had erewhile been used to hurl, until achilles had slain him and</p>
    <p class=l>and from his whirling arm dismiss in air;<br />the giant by achilles slain, he stow’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>carried it off in his ships along with other spoils.</p>
    <p class=l>among his spoils this memorable load.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he stood up</p>
    <p class=l>for this, he bids those nervous artists vie,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and said among the argives, “stand forward, you who would essay</p>
    <p class=l>that teach the disk to sound along the sky.<br />“let him, whose might can hurl this bowl, arise;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this contest.</p>
    <p class=l>who farthest hurls it, take it as his prize;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he who wins it will have a store of iron that will</p>
    <p class=l>if he be one enrich’d with large domain<br />of downs for flocks, and arable for grain,<br />small stock of iron needs that man provide;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fields lie far from a town his shepherd or ploughman will not</p>
    <p class=l>from hence; nor ask the neighbouring city’s aid</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have to make a journey to buy iron, for he will have a stock of</p>
    <p class=l>for ploughshares, wheels, and all the rural trade.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it on his own premises.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then uprose the two mighty men polypoetes and leonteus, with ajax</p>
    <p class=l>stern polypœtes stepp’d before the throng,<br />and great leonteus, more than mortal strong;<br />whose force with rival forces to oppose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of telamon and noble epeus.</p>
    <p class=l>uprose great ajax; up epeus rose.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they stood up one after the other<br />and epeus took the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him,</p>
    <p class=l>each stood in order: first epeus threw;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which set all the achaeans laughing.</p>
    <p class=l>high o’er the wondering crowds the whirling circle flew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>after him threw leonteus of<br />the race of mars.</p>
    <p class=l>leonteus next a little space surpass’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ajax son of telamon threw third, and sent the</p>
    <p class=l>and third, the strength of godlike ajax cast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>quoit beyond any mark that had been made yet, but when mighty</p>
    <p class=l>o’er both their marks it flew; till fiercely flung</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>polypoetes took the quoit he hurled it as though it had been a</p>
    <p class=l>from polypœtes’ arm the discus sung:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stockman’s stick which he sends flying about among his cattle</p>
    <p class=l>far as a swain his whirling sheephook throws,<br />that distant falls among the grazing cows,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he is driving them, so far did his throw out-distance those<br />of the others.</p>
    <p class=l>so past them all the rapid circle flies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>all who saw it roared applause, and his comrades</p>
    <p class=l>his friends, while loud applauses shake the skies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>carried the prize for him and set it on board his ship.</p>
    <p class=l>with force conjoin’d heave off the weighty prize.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles next offered a prize of iron for archery—ten</p>
    <p class=l>those, who in skilful archery contend,<br />he next invites the twanging bow to bend;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>double-edged axes and ten with single edges: he set up a ship’s</p>
    <p class=l>and twice ten axes casts amidst the round,<br />ten double-edged, and ten that singly wound</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mast, some way off upon the sands, and with a fine string tied a</p>
    <p class=l>the mast, which late a first-rate galley bore,<br />the hero fixes in the sandy shore;<br />to the tall top a milk-white dove they tie,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pigeon to it by the foot; this was what they were to aim at.</p>
    <p class=l>the trembling mark at which their arrows fly.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“whoever,” he said, “can hit the pigeon shall have all the axes<br />and take them away with him; he who hits the string without</p>
    <p class=l>“whose weapon strikes yon fluttering bird, shall bear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hitting the bird will have taken a worse aim and shall have the</p>
    <p class=l>these two-edged axes, terrible in war;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>single-edged axes.</p>
    <p class=l>the single, he whose shaft divides the cord.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then uprose king teucer, and meriones the stalwart squire of</p>
    <p class=l>he said: experienced merion took the word;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>idomeneus rose also, they cast lots in a bronze helmet and the</p>
    <p class=l>and skilful teucer: in the helm they threw</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lot of teucer fell first.</p>
    <p class=l>their lots inscribed, and forth the latter flew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he let fly with his arrow forthwith,</p>
    <p class=l>swift from the string the sounding arrow flies;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but he did not promise hecatombs of firstling lambs to king</p>
    <p class=l>but flies unbless’d!<br />no grateful sacrifice,<br />no firstling lambs, unheedful!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo, and missed his bird, for apollo foiled his aim; but he</p>
    <p class=l>didst thou vow</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hit the string with which the bird was tied, near its foot; the</p>
    <p class=l>to phœbus, patron of the shaft and bow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>arrow cut the string clean through so that it hung down towards</p>
    <p class=l>for this, thy well-aim’d arrow turn’d aside,<br />err’d from the dove, yet cut the cord that tied:<br />adown the mainmast fell the parted string,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ground, while the bird flew up into the sky, and the achaeans</p>
    <p class=l>and the free bird to heaven displays her wing:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shouted applause.</p>
    <p class=l>sea, shores, and skies, with loud applause resound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones, who had his arrow ready while teucer</p>
    <p class=l>and merion eager meditates the wound:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was aiming, snatched the bow out of his hand, and at once</p>
    <p class=l>he takes the bow, directs the shaft above,<br />and following with his eye the soaring dove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>promised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of firstling lambs to</p>
    <p class=l>implores the god to speed it through the skies,<br />with vows of firstling lambs, and grateful sacrifice,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeon high up under the</p>
    <p class=l>the dove, in airy circles as she wheels,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>clouds, he hit her in the middle of the wing as she was circling</p>
    <p class=l>amid the clouds the piercing arrow feels;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>upwards; the arrow went clean through the wing and fixed itself</p>
    <p class=l>quite through and through the point its passage found,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the ground at meriones’ feet, but the bird perched on the</p>
    <p class=l>and at his feet fell bloody to the ground.<br />the wounded bird, ere yet she breathed her last,<br />with flagging wings alighted on the mast,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ship’s mast hanging her head and with all her feathers drooping;</p>
    <p class=l>a moment hung, and spread her pinions there,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the life went out of her, and she fell heavily from the mast.</p>
    <p class=l>then sudden dropp’d, and left her life in air.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>meriones, therefore, took all ten double-edged axes, while teucer</p>
    <p class=l>from the pleased crowd new peals of thunder rise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bore off the single-edged ones to his ships.</p>
    <p class=l>and to the ships brave merion bears the prize.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then the son of peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that had</p>
    <p class=l>to close the funeral games, achilles last<br />a massy spear amid the circle placed,<br />and ample charger of unsullied frame,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>never been on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with a</p>
    <p class=l>with flowers high-wrought, not blacken’d yet by flame.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pattern of flowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up—to</p>
    <p class=l>for these he bids the heroes prove their art,<br />whose dexterous skill directs the flying dart.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wit the son of atreus, king of men agamemnon, and meriones,</p>
    <p class=l>here too great merion hopes the noble prize;<br />nor here disdain’d the king of men to rise.<br />with joy pelides saw the honour paid,<br />rose to the monarch, and respectful said:<br />“thee first in virtue, as in power supreme,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stalwart squire of idomeneus.</p>
    <p class=l>o king of nations!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but achilles spoke saying, “son of</p>
    <p class=l>all thy greeks proclaim;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus, we know how far you excel all others both in power and in</p>

    <p class=r>meriones; this at least is what i should myself wish.</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>king agamemnon assented.</p>
    <p class=l>pleased from the hero’s lips his praise to hear,<br />the king to merion gives the brazen spear:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so he gave the bronze spear to meriones,</p>
    <p class=l>but, set apart for sacred use, commands</p>

    <p class=r>him, but fear fell upon him as she did so.</p>
    <p class=l>and thus in whispers greets his trembling ears:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“take heart,” she<br />said, “priam offspring of dardanus, take heart and fear not.</p>
    <p class=l>“fear not, o father!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i<br />bring no evil tidings, but am minded well towards you.<br />i come as</p>
    <p class=l>no ill news i bear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a messenger from jove, who though he be not near, takes thought<br />for you and pities you.</p>
    <p class=l>from jove i come, jove makes thee still his care;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the lord of olympus bids you go and<br />ransom noble hector, and take with you such gifts as shall give</p>
    <p class=l>for hector’s sake these walls he bids thee leave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>satisfaction to achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>and bear what stern achilles may receive;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you are to go alone, with no trojan,</p>
    <p class=l>alone, for so he wills; no trojan near,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>save only some honoured servant who may drive your mules and</p>
    <p class=l>except, to place the dead with decent care,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>waggon, and bring back to the city the body of him whom noble</p>
    <p class=l>some aged herald, who with gentle hand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles has slain.</p>
    <p class=l>may the slow mules and funeral car command.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you are to have no thought, nor fear of<br />death, for jove will send the slayer of argus to escort you.</p>
    <p class=l>nor shalt thou death, nor shalt thou danger dread:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when</p>
    <p class=l>safe through the foe by his protection led:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he has brought you within achilles’ tent, achilles will not kill</p>
    <p class=l>thee hermes to pelides shall convey,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you nor let another do so, for he will take heed to his ways and</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sin not, and he will entreat a suppliant with all honourable</p>
    <p class=l>fierce as he is, achilles’ self shall spare<br />thy age, nor touch one venerable hair;<br />some thought there must be in a soul so brave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>courtesy.</p>
    <p class=l>some sense of duty, some desire to save.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>iris went her way when she had thus spoken, and priam told his</p>
    <p class=l>she spoke, and vanish’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sons to get a mule-waggon ready, and to make the body of the</p>
    <p class=l>priam bids prepare<br />his gentle mules and harness to the car;<br />there, for the gifts, a polish’d casket lay:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>waggon fast upon the top of its bed.</p>
    <p class=l>his pious sons the king’s command obey.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he went down into his</p>
    <p class=l>then pass’d the monarch to his bridal-room,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fragrant store-room, high-vaulted, and made of cedar-wood, where</p>
    <p class=l>where cedar-beams the lofty roofs perfume,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his many treasures were kept, and he called hecuba his wife.</p>
    <p class=l>and where the treasures of his empire lay;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“wife,” said he, “a messenger has come to me from olympus, and</p>
    <p class=l>then call’d his queen, and thus began to say:<br />“unhappy consort of a king distress’d!<br />partake the troubles of thy husband’s breast:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>has told me to go to the ships of the achaeans to ransom my dear</p>
    <p class=l>i saw descend the messenger of jove,<br />who bids me try achilles’ mind to move;<br />forsake these ramparts, and with gifts obtain<br />the corse of hector, at yon navy slain.<br />tell me thy thought: my heart impels to go</p>

    <p class=r>what think you of this matter?</p>
    <p class=l>whither wanders thy distemper’d mind?<br />and where the prudence now that awed mankind?</p>

    <p class=r>his wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, “alas, what has</p>
    <p class=l>) the murderer of thy race!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>become of that judgement for which you have been ever famous both</p>
    <p class=l>to view that deathful eye, and wander o’er<br />those hands yet red with hector’s noble gore!</p>

    <p class=r>slain so many of your brave sons?</p>
    <p class=l>so brave!<br />so many fallen!</p>

    <p class=r>you must have iron courage, for</p>
    <p class=l>to claim his rage</p>

    <p class=r>if the cruel savage sees you and lays hold on you, he will know<br />neither respect nor pity.</p>
    <p class=l>vain were thy dignity, and vain thy age.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let us then weep hector from afar here</p>
    <p class=l>no—pent in this sad palace, let us give<br />to grief the wretched days we have to live.<br />still, still for hector let our sorrows flow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in our own house, for when i gave him birth the threads of</p>

    <p class=r>overruling fate were spun for him that dogs should eat his flesh</p>
    <p class=l>doom’d from the hour his luckless life begun,<br />to dogs, to vultures, and to peleus’ son!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>far from his parents, in the house of that terrible man on whose</p>
    <p class=l>oh!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>liver i would fain fasten and devour it.</p>
    <p class=l>in his dearest blood might i allay<br />my rage, and these barbarities repay!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus would i avenge my</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son, who showed no cowardice when achilles slew him, and thought</p>
    <p class=l>expired not meanly, in unactive death?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>neither of flight nor of avoiding battle as he stood in defence</p>
    <p class=l>he poured his latest blood in manly fight,</p>

    <hr />

    <p class=r>had it</p>
    <p class=l>with words of omen, like a bird of night,</p>

    <p class=r>given him no heed; but now i have heard the goddess and seen her</p>
    <p class=l>nor augur, priest, nor seer, had been obey’d.<br />a present goddess brought the high command,</p>

    <p class=r>taken my son in my arms and mourned him to my heart’s</p>

    <p class=r>comforting.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelve</p>
    <p class=l>from forth his open’d stores, this said, he drew<br />twelve costly carpets of refulgent hue,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>goodly vestments.</p>
    <p class=l>as many vests, as many mantles told,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he took also twelve cloaks of single fold,<br />twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts.</p>
    <p class=l>and twelve fair veils, and garments stiff with gold,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he weighed out ten talents of gold, and brought moreover two</p>
    <p class=l>two tripods next, and twice two chargers shine,<br />with ten pure talents from the richest mine;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>burnished tripods, four cauldrons, and a very beautiful cup which</p>
    <p class=l>and last a large well-labour’d bowl had place,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the thracians had given him when he had gone to them on an</p>
    <p class=l>(the pledge of treaties once with friendly thrace:)<br />seem’d all too mean the stores he could employ,<br />for one last look to buy him back to troy!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>embassy; it was very precious, but he grudged not even this, so</p>
    <p class=l>lo!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eager was he to ransom the body of his son.</p>
    <p class=l>the sad father, frantic with his pain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he chased all</p>
    <p class=l>around him furious drives his menial train:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the trojans from the court and rebuked them with words of anger.</p>
    <p class=l>in vain each slave with duteous care attends,<br />each office hurts him, and each face offends.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“out,” he cried, “shame and disgrace to me that you are.</p>
    <p class=l>“what make ye here, officious crowds!<br />(he cries):</p>

    <p class=r>old man sped them.</p>
    <p class=l>the sorrowing friends his frantic rage obey.</p>

    <p class=r>the old man call near him.</p>
    <p class=l>survived, sad relics of his numerous line.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“come to me at once,” he cried,<br />“worthless sons who do me shame; would that you had all been</p>
    <p class=l>“inglorious sons of an unhappy sire!</p>

    <p class=r>body of the waggon fast on its bed.</p>
    <p class=l>high on the seat the cabinet they bind:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they took the mule-yoke from</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the peg on which it hung, a yoke of boxwood with a knob on the</p>

    <p class=r>top of it and rings for the reins to go through.<br />then they</p>
    <p class=l>and hung with ringlets to receive the reins;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brought a yoke-band eleven cubits long, to bind the yoke to the</p>
    <p class=l>nine cubits long, the traces swept the ground:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>pole; they bound it on at the far end of the pole, and put the</p>
    <p class=l>these to the chariot’s polish’d pole they bound.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ring over the upright pin making it fast with three turns of the</p>
    <p class=l>then fix’d a ring the running reins to guide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>band on either side the knob, and bending the thong of the yoke<br />beneath it.</p>
    <p class=l>and close beneath the gather’d ends were tied.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this done, they brought from the store-chamber the</p>
    <p class=l>next with the gifts (the price of hector slain)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rich ransom that was to purchase the body of hector, and they set</p>
    <p class=l>the sad attendants load the groaning wain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it all orderly on the waggon; then they yoked the strong</p>
    <p class=l>last to the yoke the well-matched mules they bring,</p>

    <p class=r>harness-mules which the mysians had on a time given as a goodly</p>

    <p class=l>that sign beheld, and strengthen’d from above,<br />boldly pursue the journey mark’d by jove:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>however set upon it you may be, i would not have you go to the</p>
    <p class=l>but if the god his augury denies,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ships of the argives.</p>
    <p class=l>suppress thy impulse, nor reject advice.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and priam answered, “wife, i will do as you desire me; it is well</p>
    <p class=l>“’tis just (said priam) to the sire above</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to lift hands in prayer to jove, if so be he may have mercy upon</p>
    <p class=l>to raise our hands; for who so good as jove?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with this the old man bade the serving-woman pour pure water over</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, and bade the attendant handmaid bring<br />the purest water of the living spring:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his hands, and the woman came, bearing the water in a bowl.<br />he</p>
    <p class=l>(her ready hands the ewer and bason held:)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>washed his hands and took the cup from his wife; then he made the</p>
    <p class=l>then took the golden cup his queen had fill’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drink-offering and prayed, standing in the middle of the</p>
    <p class=l>on the mid pavement pours the rosy wine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>courtyard and turning his eyes to heaven.</p>
    <p class=l>uplifts his eyes, and calls the power divine:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“father jove,” he said,</p>
    <p class=l>“o first and greatest!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“that rulest from ida, most glorious and most great, grant that i</p>
    <p class=l>heaven’s imperial lord!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may be received kindly and compassionately in the tents of</p>
    <p class=l>on lofty ida’s holy hill adored!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles; and send your swift messenger upon my right hand, the</p>
    <p class=l>to stern achilles now direct my ways,<br />and teach him mercy when a father prays.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to you of all</p>
    <p class=l>if such thy will, despatch from yonder sky<br />thy sacred bird, celestial augury!<br />let the strong sovereign of the plumy race<br />tower on the right of yon ethereal space;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>birds, that i may see it with my own eyes and trust it as i go</p>
    <p class=l>so shall thy suppliant, strengthen’d from above,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forth to the ships of the danaans.</p>
    <p class=l>fearless pursue the journey mark’d by jove.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so did he pray, and jove the lord of counsel heard his prayer.</p>
    <p class=l>jove heard his prayer, and from the throne on high,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forthwith he sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all<br />birds that fly, the dusky hunter that men also call the black<br />eagle.</p>
    <p class=l>despatch’d his bird, celestial augury!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his wings were spread abroad on either side as wide as the</p>
    <p class=l>the swift-wing’d chaser of the feather’d game,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>well-made and well-bolted door of a rich man’s chamber.</p>
    <p class=l>and known to gods by percnos’ lofty name.<br />wide as appears some palace-gate display’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he came</p>
    <p class=l>so broad, his pinions stretch’d their ample shade,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to them flying over the city upon their right hands, and when</p>
    <p class=l>as stooping dexter with resounding wings<br />the imperial bird descends in airy rings.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they saw him they were glad and their hearts took comfort within</p>
    <p class=l>a dawn of joy in every face appears:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them.</p>
    <p class=l>the mourning matron dries her timorous tears:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the old man made haste to mount his chariot, and drove out</p>
    <p class=l>swift on his car the impatient monarch sprung;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the<br />outer court.</p>
    <p class=l>the brazen portal in his passage rung;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>before him went the mules drawing the four-wheeled</p>
    <p class=l>the mules preceding draw the loaded wain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>waggon, and driven by wise idaeus; behind these were the horses,</p>
    <p class=l>charged with the gifts: idæus holds the rein:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which the old man lashed with his whip and drove swiftly through</p>
    <p class=l>the king himself his gentle steeds controls,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the city, while his friends followed after, wailing and lamenting</p>
    <p class=l>and through surrounding friends the chariot rolls.<br />on his slow wheels the following people wait,<br />mourn at each step, and give him up to fate;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for him as though he were on his road to death.</p>
    <p class=l>with hands uplifted eye him as he pass’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as soon as they</p>
    <p class=l>and gaze upon him as they gazed their last.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had come down from the city and had reached the plain, his sons</p>
    <p class=l>now forward fares the father on his way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and sons-in-law who had followed him went back to ilius.<br />but priam and idaeus as they showed out upon the plain did not</p>
    <p class=l>through the lone fields, and back to ilion they.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>escape the ken of all-seeing jove, who looked down upon the old</p>
    <p class=l>great jove beheld him as he cross’d the plain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>man and pitied him; then he spoke to his son mercury and said,</p>
    <p class=l>and felt the woes of miserable man.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“mercury, for it is you who are the most disposed to escort men</p>
    <p class=l>then thus to hermes: “thou whose constant cares</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on their way, and to hear those whom you will hear, go, and so</p>
    <p class=l>still succour mortals, and attend their prayers;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>conduct priam to the ships of the achaeans that no other of the</p>
    <p class=l>behold an object to thy charge consign’d:<br />if ever pity touch’d thee for mankind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>danaans shall see him nor take note of him until he reach the son</p>
    <p class=l>go, guard the sire: the observing foe prevent,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of peleus.</p>
    <p class=l>and safe conduct him to achilles’ tent.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus he spoke and mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of argus,<br />did as he was told.<br />forthwith he bound on his glittering golden</p>
    <p class=l>the god obeys, his golden pinions binds,[294]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sandals with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea;</p>
    <p class=l>and mounts incumbent on the wings of winds,<br />that high, through fields of air, his flight sustain,<br />o’er the wide earth, and o’er the boundless main;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he took the wand with which he seals men’s eyes in sleep, or</p>
    <p class=l>then grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly,<br />or in soft slumbers seals the wakeful eye:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wakes them just as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand</p>
    <p class=l>thus arm’d, swift hermes steers his airy way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>till he came to troy and to the hellespont.</p>
    <p class=l>and stoops on hellespont’s resounding sea.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to look at, he was</p>
    <p class=l>a beauteous youth, majestic and divine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like a young man of noble birth in the hey-day of his youth and</p>
    <p class=l>he seem’d; fair offspring of some princely line!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>beauty with the down just coming upon his face.</p>
    <p class=l>now twilight veil’d the glaring face of day,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now when priam and idaeus had driven past the great tomb of</p>
    <p class=l>and clad the dusky fields in sober grey;<br />what time the herald and the hoary king</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ilius, they stayed their mules and horses that they might drink</p>
    <p class=l>(their chariots stopping at the silver spring,<br />that circling ilus’ ancient marble flows)<br />allow’d their mules and steeds a short repose,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in the river, for the shades of night were falling, when,</p>
    <p class=l>through the dim shade the herald first espies</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, idaeus saw mercury standing near them he said to</p>
    <p class=l>a man’s approach, and thus to priam cries:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam, “take heed, descendant of dardanus; here is matter which</p>
    <p class=l>“i mark some foe’s advance: o king!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>demands consideration.</p>
    <p class=l>beware;<br />this hard adventure claims thy utmost care!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i see a man who i think will presently</p>
    <p class=l>for much i fear destruction hovers nigh:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fall upon us; let us fly with our horses, or at least embrace his</p>
    <p class=l>our state asks counsel; is it best to fly?<br />or old and helpless, at his feet to fall,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>knees and implore him to take compassion upon us?</p>
    <p class=l>two wretched suppliants, and for mercy call?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he heard this the old man’s heart failed him, and he was in</p>
    <p class=l>the afflicted monarch shiver’d with despair;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>great fear; he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair</p>
    <p class=l>pale grew his face, and upright stood his hair;<br />sunk was his heart; his colour went and came;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>stood on end over his whole body; but the bringer of good luck</p>
    <p class=l>a sudden trembling shook his aged frame:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>came up to him and took him by the hand, saying, “whither,</p>
    <p class=l>when hermes, greeting, touch’d his royal hand,<br />and, gentle, thus accosts with kind demand:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father, are you thus driving your mules and horses in the dead of</p>
    <p class=l>“say whither, father!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>night when other men are asleep?</p>
    <p class=l>when each mortal sight<br />is seal’d in sleep, thou wanderest through the night?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are you not afraid of the fierce</p>
    <p class=l>why roam thy mules and steeds the plains along,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans who are hard by you, so cruel and relentless?</p>
    <p class=l>through grecian foes, so numerous and so strong?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should<br />some one of them see you bearing so much treasure through the</p>
    <p class=l>what couldst thou hope, should these thy treasures view;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>darkness of the flying night, what would not your state then be?<br />you are no longer young, and he who is with you is too old to</p>
    <p class=l>these, who with endless hate thy race pursue?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>protect you from those who would attack you.</p>
    <p class=l>for what defence, alas!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for myself, i will</p>
    <p class=l>could’st thou provide;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>do you no harm, and i will defend you from any one else, for you</p>
    <p class=l>thyself not young, a weak old man thy guide?<br />yet suffer not thy soul to sink with dread;<br />from me no harm shall touch thy reverend head;<br />from greece i’ll guard thee too; for in those lines</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>remind me of my own father.</p>
    <p class=l>the living image of my father shines.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and priam answered, “it is indeed as you say, my dear son;</p>
    <p class=l>“thy words, that speak benevolence of mind,<br />are true, my son!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nevertheless some god has held his hand over me, in that he has</p>
    <p class=l>(the godlike sire rejoin’d:)<br />great are my hazards; but the gods survey</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sent such a wayfarer as yourself to meet me so opportunely; you</p>
    <p class=l>my steps, and send thee, guardian of my way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are so comely in mien and figure, and your judgement is so</p>
    <p class=l>hail, and be bless’d!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>excellent that you must come of blessed parents.</p>
    <p class=l>for scarce of mortal kind<br />appear thy form, thy feature, and thy mind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then said the slayer of argus, guide and guardian, “sir, all that</p>
    <p class=l>“nor true are all thy words, nor erring wide;<br />(the sacred messenger of heaven replied;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you have said is right; but tell me and tell me true, are you</p>
    <p class=l>but say, convey’st thou through the lonely plains</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>taking this rich treasure to send it to a foreign people where it</p>
    <p class=l>what yet most precious of thy store remains,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may be safe, or are you all leaving strong ilius in dismay now</p>
    <p class=l>to lodge in safety with some friendly hand:<br />prepared, perchance, to leave thy native land?<br />or fliest thou now?<br />—what hopes can troy retain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that your son has fallen who was the bravest man among you and<br />was never lacking in battle with the achaeans?</p>
    <p class=l>thy matchless son, her guard and glory, slain?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and priam said, “who are you, my friend, and who are your</p>
    <p class=l>the king, alarm’d: “say what, and whence thou art</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>parents, that you speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy</p>
    <p class=l>who search the sorrows of a parent’s heart,<br />and know so well how godlike hector died?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son?<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the slayer of argus, guide and guardian, answered him, “sir, you</p>
    <p class=l>thus priam spoke, and hermes thus replied:<br />“you tempt me, father, and with pity touch:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>would prove me, that you question me about noble hector.</p>
    <p class=l>on this sad subject you inquire too much.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many a</p>
    <p class=l>oft have these eyes that godlike hector view’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>time have i set eyes upon him in battle when he was driving the</p>
    <p class=l>in glorious fight, with grecian blood embrued:<br />i saw him when, like jove, his flames he toss’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>argives to their ships and putting them to the sword.</p>
    <p class=l>on thousand ships, and wither’d half a host:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>we stood</p>
    <p class=l>i saw, but help’d not: stern achilles’ ire</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>still and marvelled, for achilles in his anger with the son of</p>
    <p class=l>forbade assistance, and enjoy’d the fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>atreus suffered us not to fight.<br />i am his squire, and came with</p>
    <p class=l>for him i serve, of myrmidonian race;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him in the same ship.</p>
    <p class=l>one ship convey’d us from our native place;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i am a myrmidon, and my father’s name is</p>
    <p class=l>polyctor is my sire, an honour’d name,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>polyctor: he is a rich man and about as old as you are; he has</p>
    <p class=l>old like thyself, and not unknown to fame;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>six sons besides myself, and i am the seventh.<br />we cast lots, and</p>
    <p class=l>of seven his sons, by whom the lot was cast</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it fell upon me to sail hither with achilles.</p>
    <p class=l>to serve our prince, it fell on me, the last.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i am now come from</p>
    <p class=l>to watch this quarter, my adventure falls:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ships on to the plain, for with daybreak the achaeans will<br />set battle in array about the city.</p>
    <p class=l>for with the morn the greeks attack your walls;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they chafe at doing nothing,</p>
    <p class=l>sleepless they sit, impatient to engage,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and are so eager that their princes cannot hold them back.</p>
    <p class=l>and scarce their rulers check their martial rage.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then answered priam, “if you are indeed the squire of achilles</p>
    <p class=l>“if then thou art of stern pelides’ train,<br />(the mournful monarch thus rejoin’d again,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of peleus, tell me now the whole truth.</p>
    <p class=l>ah tell me truly, where, oh!</p>

    <p class=l>where are laid<br />my son’s dear relics?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ships, or has achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him</p>
    <p class=l>what befalls him dead?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to his hounds?</p>
    <p class=l>have dogs dismember’d (on the naked plains),<br />or yet unmangled rest, his cold remains?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“sir,” replied the slayer of argus, guide and guardian, “neither</p>
    <p class=l>“o favour’d of the skies!<br />(thus answered then<br />the power that mediates between god and men)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hounds nor vultures have yet devoured him; he is still just lying</p>
    <p class=l>nor dogs nor vultures have thy hector rent,<br />but whole he lies, neglected in the tent:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at the tents by the ship of achilles, and though it is now twelve<br />days that he has lain there, his flesh is not wasted nor have the</p>
    <p class=l>this the twelfth evening since he rested there,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>worms eaten him although they feed on warriors.</p>
    <p class=l>untouch’d by worms, untainted by the air.<br />still as aurora’s ruddy beam is spread,<br />round his friend’s tomb achilles drags the dead:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at daybreak</p>
    <p class=l>yet undisfigured, or in limb or face,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles drags him cruelly round the sepulchre of his dear</p>
    <p class=l>all fresh he lies, with every living grace,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>comrade, but it does him no hurt.</p>
    <p class=l>majestical in death!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you should come yourself and</p>
    <p class=l>no stains are found</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see how he lies fresh as dew, with the blood all washed away, and</p>
    <p class=l>o’er all the corse, and closed is every wound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>his wounds every one of them closed though many pierced him with<br />their spears.</p>
    <p class=l>though many a wound they gave.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>such care have the blessed gods taken of your brave</p>
    <p class=l>some heavenly care,<br />some hand divine, preserves him ever fair:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son, for he was dear to them beyond all measure.</p>
    <p class=l>or all the host of heaven, to whom he led<br />a life so grateful, still regard him dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the old man was comforted as he heard him and said, “my son, see</p>
    <p class=l>thus spoke to priam the celestial guide,<br />and joyful thus the royal sire replied:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>what a good thing it is to have made due offerings to the</p>
    <p class=l>“blest is the man who pays the gods above</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>immortals; for as sure as that he was born my son never forgot</p>
    <p class=l>the constant tribute of respect and love!<br />those who inhabit the olympian bower<br />my son forgot not, in exalted power;</p>

    <p class=r>the gods that hold olympus, and now they requite it to him even</p>
    <p class=l>and heaven, that every virtue bears in mind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in death.</p>
    <p class=l>even to the ashes of the just is kind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>accept therefore at my hands this goodly chalice; guard</p>
    <p class=l>but thou, o generous youth!<br />this goblet take,<br />a pledge of gratitude for hector’s sake;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me and with heaven’s help guide me till i come to the tent of the</p>
    <p class=l>and while the favouring gods our steps survey,<br />safe to pelides’ tent conduct my way.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>son of peleus.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then answered the slayer of argus, guide and guardian, “sir, you</p>
    <p class=l>to whom the latent god: “o king, forbear</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>are tempting me and playing upon my youth, but you shall not move</p>
    <p class=l>to tempt my youth, for apt is youth to err.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me, for you are offering me presents without the knowledge of</p>
    <p class=l>but can i, absent from my prince’s sight,<br />take gifts in secret, that must shun the light?<br />what from our master’s interest thus we draw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles whom i fear and hold it great guilt to defraud, lest</p>
    <p class=l>is but a licensed theft that ’scapes the law.<br />respecting him, my soul abjures the offence;<br />and as the crime, i dread the consequence.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>some evil presently befall me; but as your guide i would go with</p>
    <p class=l>thee, far as argos, pleased i could convey;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you even to argos itself, and would guard you so carefully</p>
    <p class=l>guard of thy life, and partner of thy way:<br />on thee attend, thy safety to maintain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>whether by sea or land, that no one should attack you through<br />making light of him who was with you.</p>
    <p class=l>o’er pathless forests, or the roaring main.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, and</p>
    <p class=l>he said, then took the chariot at a bound,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>seizing the whip and reins he breathed fresh spirit into the</p>
    <p class=l>and snatch’d the reins, and whirl’d the lash around:<br />before the inspiring god that urged them on,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mules and horses.</p>
    <p class=l>the coursers fly with spirit not their own.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they reached the trench and the wall that</p>
    <p class=l>and now they reach’d the naval walls, and found</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was before the ships, those who were on guard had just been</p>
    <p class=l>the guards repasting, while the bowls go round;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>getting their suppers, and the slayer of argus threw them all</p>
    <p class=l>on these the virtue of his wand he tries,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into a deep sleep.</p>
    <p class=l>and pours deep slumber on their watchful eyes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he drew back the bolts to open the gates,</p>
    <p class=l>then heaved the massy gates, removed the bars,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and took priam inside with the treasure he had upon his waggon.</p>
    <p class=l>and o’er the trenches led the rolling cars.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ere long they came to the lofty dwelling of the son of peleus for</p>
    <p class=l>unseen, through all the hostile camp they went,<br />and now approach’d pelides’ lofty tent.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which the myrmidons had cut pine and which they had built for<br />their king; when they had built it they thatched it with coarse<br />tussock-grass which they had mown out on the plain, and all round</p>
    <p class=l>on firs the roof was raised, and cover’d o’er</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it they made a large courtyard, which was fenced with stakes set</p>
    <p class=l>with reeds collected from the marshy shore;<br />and, fenced with palisades, a hall of state,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>close together.</p>
    <p class=l>(the work of soldiers,) where the hero sat:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the gate was barred with a single bolt of pine</p>
    <p class=l>large was the door, whose well-compacted strength<br />a solid pine-tree barr’d of wondrous length:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>which it took three men to force into its place, and three to</p>
    <p class=l>scarce three strong greeks could lift its mighty weight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>draw back so as to open the gate, but achilles could draw it by</p>
    <p class=l>but great achilles singly closed the gate.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>himself.</p>
    <p class=l>this hermes (such the power of gods) set wide;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mercury opened the gate for the old man, and brought in</p>
    <p class=l>then swift alighted the celestial guide,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the treasure that he was taking with him for the son of peleus.</p>
    <p class=l>and thus reveal’d—”hear, prince!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he sprang from the chariot on to the ground and said, “sir,</p>
    <p class=l>and understand</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it is i, immortal mercury, that am come with you, for my father</p>
    <p class=l>thou ow’st thy guidance to no mortal hand:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sent me to escort you.</p>
    <p class=l>hermes i am, descended from above,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i will now leave you, and will not enter</p>
    <p class=l>the king of arts, the messenger of jove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>into the presence of achilles, for it might anger him that a god</p>
    <p class=l>farewell: to shun achilles’ sight i fly;<br />uncommon are such favours of the sky,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should befriend mortal men thus openly.</p>
    <p class=l>nor stand confess’d to frail mortality.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>go you within, and</p>
    <p class=l>now fearless enter, and prefer thy prayers;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>embrace the knees of the son of peleus: beseech him by his</p>
    <p class=l>adjure him by his father’s silver hairs,<br />his son, his mother!<br />urge him to bestow</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father, his lovely mother, and his son; thus you may move him.</p>
    <p class=l>whatever pity that stern heart can know.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with these words mercury went back to high olympus.</p>
    <p class=l>thus having said, he vanish’d from his eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>priam sprang</p>
    <p class=l>and in a moment shot into the skies:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from his chariot to the ground, leaving idaeus where he was, in</p>
    <p class=l>the king, confirm’d from heaven, alighted there,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>charge of the mules and horses.<br />the old man went straight into</p>
    <p class=l>and left his aged herald on the car,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the house where achilles, loved of the gods, was sitting.</p>
    <p class=l>with solemn pace through various rooms he went,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>there</p>
    <p class=l>and found achilles in his inner tent:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he found him with his men seated at a distance from him: only</p>
    <p class=l>there sat the hero: alcimus the brave,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>two, the hero automedon, and alcimus of the race of mars, were</p>
    <p class=l>and great automedon, attendance gave:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>busy in attendance about his person, for he had but just done</p>
    <p class=l>these served his person at the royal feast;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>eating and drinking, and the table was still there.</p>
    <p class=l>around, at awful distance, stood the rest.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>king priam</p>
    <p class=l>unseen by these, the king his entry made:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>entered without their seeing him, and going right up to achilles</p>
    <p class=l>and, prostrate now before achilles laid,<br />sudden (a venerable sight!<br />) appears;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he clasped his knees and kissed the dread murderous hands that</p>
    <p class=l>embraced his knees, and bathed his hands in tears;<br />those direful hands his kisses press’d, embrued</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had slain so many of his sons.</p>
    <p class=l>even with the best, the dearest of his blood!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as when some cruel spite has befallen a man that he should have</p>
    <p class=l>as when a wretch (who, conscious of his crime,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>killed some one in his own country, and must fly to a great man’s</p>
    <p class=l>pursued for murder, flies his native clime)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>protection in a land of strangers, and all marvel who see him,</p>
    <p class=l>just gains some frontier, breathless, pale, amazed,<br />all gaze, all wonder: thus achilles gazed:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so did achilles marvel as he beheld priam.</p>
    <p class=l>thus stood the attendants stupid with surprise:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the others looked</p>
    <p class=l>all mute, yet seem’d to question with their eyes:<br />each look’d on other, none the silence broke,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>one to another and marvelled also, but priam besought achilles</p>
    <p class=l>till thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saying, “think of your father, o achilles like unto the gods, who</p>
    <p class=l>“ah think, thou favour’d of the powers divine!<br />[295]<br />think of thy father’s age, and pity mine!<br />in me that father’s reverend image trace,<br />those silver hairs, that venerable face;<br />his trembling limbs, his helpless person, see!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is such even as i am, on the sad threshold of old age.</p>
    <p class=l>in all my equal, but in misery!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it may be</p>
    <p class=l>yet now, perhaps, some turn of human fate</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that those who dwell near him harass him, and there is none to</p>
    <p class=l>expels him helpless from his peaceful state;<br />think, from some powerful foe thou seest him fly,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>keep war and ruin from him.</p>
    <p class=l>and beg protection with a feeble cry.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>yet when he hears of you being still</p>
    <p class=l>yet still one comfort in his soul may rise;<br />he hears his son still lives to glad his eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alive, he is glad, and his days are full of hope that he shall</p>
    <p class=l>and, hearing, still may hope a better day</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>see his dear son come home to him from troy; but i, wretched man</p>
    <p class=l>may send him thee, to chase that foe away.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>that i am, had the bravest in all troy for my sons, and there is</p>
    <p class=l>no comfort to my griefs, no hopes remain,<br />the best, the bravest, of my sons are slain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not one of them left.</p>
    <p class=l>yet what a race!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i had fifty sons when the achaeans came</p>
    <p class=l>ere greece to ilion came,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>here; nineteen of them were from a single womb, and the others</p>
    <p class=l>the pledge of many a loved and loving dame:<br />nineteen one mother bore—dead, all are dead!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>were borne to me by the women of my household.</p>
    <p class=l>how oft, alas!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the greater part</p>
    <p class=l>has wretched priam bled!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of them has fierce mars laid low, and hector, him who was alone</p>
    <p class=l>still one was left their loss to recompense;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>left, him who was the guardian of the city and ourselves, him</p>
    <p class=l>his father’s hope, his country’s last defence.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have you lately slain; therefore i am now come to the ships of</p>
    <p class=l>him too thy rage has slain!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the achaeans to ransom his body from you with a great ransom.</p>
    <p class=l>beneath thy steel,<br />unhappy in his country’s cause he fell!<br />“for him through hostile camps i bent my way,<br />for him thus prostrate at thy feet i lay;<br />large gifts proportion’d to thy wrath i bear;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>fear, o achilles, the wrath of heaven; think on your own father</p>
    <p class=l>o hear the wretched, and the gods revere!<br />“think of thy father, and this face behold!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and have compassion upon me, who am the more pitiable, for i have</p>
    <p class=l>see him in me, as helpless and as old!<br />though not so wretched: there he yields to me,<br />the first of men in sovereign misery!<br />thus forced to kneel, thus grovelling to embrace</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>steeled myself as no man yet has ever steeled himself before me,</p>
    <p class=l>the scourge and ruin of my realm and race;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and have raised to my lips the hand of him who slew my son.</p>
    <p class=l>suppliant my children’s murderer to implore,<br />and kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus spoke priam, and the heart of achilles yearned as he</p>
    <p class=l>these words soft pity in the chief inspire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bethought him of his father.</p>
    <p class=l>touch’d with the dear remembrance of his sire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he took the old man’s hand and moved</p>
    <p class=l>then with his hand (as prostrate still he lay)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him gently away.</p>
    <p class=l>the old man’s cheek he gently turn’d away.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the two wept bitterly—priam, as he lay at</p>
    <p class=l>now each by turns indulged the gush of woe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles’ feet, weeping for hector, and achilles now for his</p>
    <p class=l>and now the mingled tides together flow:<br />this low on earth, that gently bending o’er;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father and now for patroclus, till the house was filled with</p>
    <p class=l>a father one, and one a son deplore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their lamentation.</p>
    <p class=l>but great achilles different passions rend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but when achilles was now sated with grief and</p>
    <p class=l>and now his sire he mourns, and now his friend.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>had unburthened the bitterness of his sorrow, he left his seat</p>
    <p class=l>the infectious softness through the heroes ran;<br />one universal solemn shower began;<br />they bore as heroes, but they felt as man.<br />satiate at length with unavailing woes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and raised the old man by the hand, in pity for his white hair</p>
    <p class=l>from the high throne divine achilles rose;<br />the reverend monarch by the hand he raised;<br />on his white beard and form majestic gazed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and beard; then he said, “unhappy man, you have indeed been</p>
    <p class=l>not unrelenting; then serene began<br />with words to soothe the miserable man:<br />“alas, what weight of anguish hast thou known,<br />unhappy prince!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>greatly daring; how could you venture to come alone to the ships</p>
    <p class=l>thus guardless and alone</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the achaeans, and enter the presence of him who has slain so</p>
    <p class=l>to pass through foes, and thus undaunted face</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many of your brave sons?</p>
    <p class=l>the man whose fury has destroy’d thy race!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you must have iron courage: sit now upon</p>
    <p class=l>heaven sure has arm’d thee with a heart of steel,<br />a strength proportion’d to the woes you feel.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this seat, and for all our grief we will hide our sorrows in our</p>
    <p class=l>rise, then: let reason mitigate your care:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hearts, for weeping will not avail us.</p>
    <p class=l>to mourn avails not: man is born to bear.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the immortals know no</p>
    <p class=l>such is, alas!<br />the gods’ severe decree:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>care, yet the lot they spin for man is full of sorrow; on the</p>
    <p class=l>they, only they are blest, and only free.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>floor of jove’s palace there stand two urns, the one filled with</p>
    <p class=l>two urns by jove’s high throne have ever stood,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>evil gifts, and the other with good ones.</p>
    <p class=l>the source of evil one, and one of good;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he for whom jove the</p>
    <p class=l>from thence the cup of mortal man he fills,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now with good</p>
    <p class=l>blessings to these, to those distributes ill;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now with evil fortune; but he to whom jove sends none but</p>
    <p class=l>to most he mingles both: the wretch decreed</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of</p>
    <p class=l>to taste the bad unmix’d, is cursed indeed;<br />pursued by wrongs, by meagre famine driven,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>famine will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go<br />up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor</p>
    <p class=l>he wanders, outcast both of earth and heaven.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>men.</p>
    <p class=l>the happiest taste not happiness sincere;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>even so did it befall peleus; the gods endowed him with all</p>
    <p class=l>but find the cordial draught is dash’d with care.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>good things from his birth upwards, for he reigned over the<br />myrmidons excelling all men in prosperity and wealth, and mortal</p>
    <p class=l>who more than peleus shone in wealth and power</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>though he was they gave him a goddess for his bride.</p>
    <p class=l>what stars concurring bless’d his natal hour!<br />a realm, a goddess, to his wishes given;<br />graced by the gods with all the gifts of heaven.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>but even on</p>
    <p class=l>one evil yet o’ertakes his latest day:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him too did heaven send misfortune, for there is no race of royal</p>
    <p class=l>no race succeeding to imperial sway;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>children born to him in his house, save one son who is doomed to</p>
    <p class=l>an only son; and he, alas!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>die all untimely; nor may i take care of him now that he is</p>
    <p class=l>ordain’d</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>growing old, for i must stay here at troy to be the bane of you</p>
    <p class=l>to fall untimely in a foreign land.<br />see him, in troy, the pious care decline</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and your children.</p>
    <p class=l>of his weak age, to live the curse of thine!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and you too, o priam, i have heard that you<br />were aforetime happy.</p>
    <p class=l>thou too, old man, hast happier days beheld;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they say that in wealth and plenitude of</p>
    <p class=l>in riches once, in children once excell’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>offspring you surpassed all that is in lesbos, the realm of makar</p>
    <p class=l>extended phrygia own’d thy ample reign,<br />and all fair lesbos’ blissful seats contain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to the northward, phrygia that is more inland, and those that</p>
    <p class=l>and all wide hellespont’s unmeasured main.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dwell upon the great hellespont; but from the day when the</p>
    <p class=l>but since the god his hand has pleased to turn,<br />and fill thy measure from his bitter urn,<br />what sees the sun, but hapless heroes’ falls?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dwellers in heaven sent this evil upon you, war and slaughter</p>
    <p class=l>war, and the blood of men, surround thy walls!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have been about your city continually.</p>
    <p class=l>what must be, must be.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bear up against it, and</p>
    <p class=l>bear thy lot, nor shed</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>let there be some intervals in your sorrow.<br />mourn as you may for</p>
    <p class=l>these unavailing sorrows o’er the dead;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your brave son, you will take nothing by it.<br />you cannot raise him</p>
    <p class=l>thou canst not call him from the stygian shore,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>from the dead, ere you do so yet another sorrow shall befall</p>
    <p class=l>but thou, alas!<br />may’st live to suffer more!</p>

    <p class=r>you.<br />”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and priam answered, “o king, bid me not be seated, while hector</p>
    <p class=l>to whom the king: “o favour’d of the skies!<br />here let me grow to earth!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>is still lying uncared for in your tents, but accept the great</p>

    <p class=r>i may look upon him.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>may you prosper with the ransom and reach</p>
    <p class=l>thou, as thou may’st, these boundless stores enjoy;<br />safe may’st thou sail, and turn thy wrath from troy;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your own land in safety, seeing that you have suffered me to live</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles looked at him sternly and said, “vex me, sir, no longer;</p>
    <p class=l>“move me no more, (achilles thus replies,<br />while kindling anger sparkled in his eyes,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>i am of myself minded to give up the body of hector.</p>
    <p class=l>nor seek by tears my steady soul to bend:<br />to yield thy hector i myself intend:</p>

    <p class=r>my mother,</p>
    <p class=l>for know, from jove my goddess-mother came,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>daughter of the old man of the sea, came to me from jove to bid</p>

    <p class=r>me deliver it to you.<br />moreover i know well, o priam, and you</p>
    <p class=l>nor comest thou but by heaven; nor comest alone,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>cannot hide it, that some god has brought you to the ships of the</p>
    <p class=l>some god impels with courage not thy own:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achaeans, for else, no man however strong and in his prime would</p>
    <p class=l>no human hand the weighty gates unbarr’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dare to come to our host; he could neither pass our guard unseen,</p>
    <p class=l>nor could the boldest of our youth have dared</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nor draw the bolt of my gates thus easily; therefore, provoke me</p>
    <p class=l>to pass our outworks, or elude the guard.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>no further, lest i sin against the word of jove, and suffer you</p>
    <p class=l>cease; lest, neglectful of high jove’s command,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not, suppliant though you are, within my tents.</p>
    <p class=l>i show thee, king!<br />thou tread’st on hostile land;<br />release my knees, thy suppliant arts give o’er,<br />and shake the purpose of my soul no more.</p>

    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the old man feared him and obeyed.<br />then the son of peleus sprang</p>
    <p class=l>the sire obey’d him, trembling and o’eraw’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>like a lion through the door of his house, not alone, but with</p>
    <p class=l>achilles, like a lion, rush’d abroad:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him went his two squires automedon and alcimus who were closer to</p>
    <p class=l>automedon and alcimus attend,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him than any others of his comrades now that patroclus was no<br />more.</p>
    <p class=l>(whom most he honour’d, since he lost his friend,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>these unyoked the horses and mules, and bade priam’s herald</p>
    <p class=l>these to unyoke the mules and horses went,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and attendant be seated within the house.</p>
    <p class=l>and led the hoary herald to the tent;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they lifted the ransom</p>
    <p class=l>next, heap’d on high, the numerous presents bear,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for hector’s body from the waggon, but they left two mantles and</p>
    <p class=l>(great hector’s ransom,) from the polish’d car.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a goodly shirt, that achilles might wrap the body in them when he</p>
    <p class=l>two splendid mantles, and a carpet spread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gave it to be taken home.</p>
    <p class=l>they leave: to cover and enwrap the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then he called to his servants and</p>
    <p class=l>then call the handmaids, with assistant toil</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ordered them to wash the body and anoint it, but he first took it</p>
    <p class=l>to wash the body and anoint with oil,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to a place where priam should not see it, lest if he did so, he</p>
    <p class=l>apart from priam: lest the unhappy sire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>should break out in the bitterness of his grief, and enrage</p>
    <p class=l>provoked to passion, once more rouse to ire</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles, who might then kill him and sin against the word of</p>
    <p class=l>the stern pelides; and nor sacred age,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>jove.</p>
    <p class=l>nor jove’s command, should check the rising rage.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when the servants had washed the body and anointed it, and<br />had wrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle, achilles himself</p>
    <p class=l>this done, the garments o’er the corse they spread;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lifted it on to a bier, and he and his men then laid it on the</p>
    <p class=l>achilles lifts it to the funeral bed:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>waggon.</p>
    <p class=l>then, while the body on the car they laid,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>he cried aloud as he did so and called on the name of his</p>
    <p class=l>he groans, and calls on loved patroclus’ shade:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dear comrade, “be not angry with me, patroclus,” he said, “if you</p>
    <p class=l>“if, in that gloom which never light must know,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hear even in the house of hades that i have given hector to his</p>
    <p class=l>the deeds of mortals touch the ghosts below,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>father for a ransom.</p>
    <p class=l>o friend!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>it has been no unworthy one, and i will</p>
    <p class=l>forgive me, that i thus fulfil<br />(restoring hector) heaven’s unquestion’d will.<br />the gifts the father gave, be ever thine,</p>

    <p class=r>share it equitably with you.</p>
    <p class=l>to grace thy manes, and adorn thy shrine.</p>

    <p class=l>”[296]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>achilles then went back into the tent and took his place on the<br />richly inlaid seat from which he had risen, by the wall that was</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and, entering, took his seat of state;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at right angles to the one against which priam was sitting.</p>
    <p class=l>where full before him reverend priam sate;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“sir,” he said, “your son is now laid upon his bier and is</p>
    <p class=l>to whom, composed, the godlike chief begun:<br />“lo!<br />to thy prayer restored, thy breathless son;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ransomed according to desire; you shall look upon him when you</p>
    <p class=l>extended on the funeral couch he lies;<br />and soon as morning paints the eastern skies,<br />the sight is granted to thy longing eyes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>take him away at daybreak; for the present let us prepare our</p>

    <p class=r>even lovely niobe had to think about eating, though her</p>
    <p class=l>thus consumed with woe,<br />the common cares that nourish life forego.<br />not thus did niobe, of form divine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>twelve children—six daughters and six lusty sons—had been all</p>
    <p class=l>a parent once, whose sorrows equall’d thine:<br />six youthful sons, as many blooming maids,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>slain in her house.</p>
    <p class=l>in one sad day beheld the stygian shades;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>apollo killed the sons with arrows from his</p>

    <p class=r>silver bow, to punish niobe, and diana slew the daughters,</p>
    <p class=l>these, cynthia’s arrows stretch’d upon the plain:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>because niobe had vaunted herself against leto; she said leto had</p>
    <p class=l>so was her pride chastised by wrath divine,<br />who match’d her own with bright latona’s line;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>borne two children only, whereas she had herself borne</p>

    <p class=r>many—whereon the two killed the many.</p>
    <p class=l>those boasted twelve, the avenging two destroy’d.<br />steep’d in their blood, and in the dust outspread,</p>

    <p class=r>nine days did they lie</p>
    <p class=l>nine days, neglected, lay exposed the dead;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>weltering, and there was none to bury them, for the son of saturn</p>
    <p class=l>none by to weep them, to inhume them none;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>turned the people into stone; but on the tenth day the gods in</p>
    <p class=l>(for jove had turn’d the nation all to stone.<br />)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>heaven themselves buried them, and niobe then took food, being</p>
    <p class=l>the gods themselves, at length relenting gave</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>worn out with weeping.</p>
    <p class=l>the unhappy race the honours of a grave.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they say that somewhere among the rocks on</p>
    <p class=l>herself a rock (for such was heaven’s high will)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the mountain pastures of sipylus, where the nymphs live that</p>
    <p class=l>through deserts wild now pours a weeping rill;<br />where round the bed whence achelous springs,<br />the watery fairies dance in mazy rings;<br />there high on sipylus’s shaggy brow,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>haunt the river achelous, there, they say, she lives in stone and</p>
    <p class=l>she stands, her own sad monument of woe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>still nurses the sorrows sent upon her by the hand of heaven.</p>
    <p class=l>the rock for ever lasts, the tears for ever flow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore, noble sir, let us two now take food; you can weep for</p>
    <p class=l>“such griefs, o king!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your dear son hereafter as you are bearing him back to ilius—and</p>
    <p class=l>have other parents known;<br />remember theirs, and mitigate thy own.<br />the care of heaven thy hector has appear’d,<br />nor shall he lie unwept, and uninterr’d;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many a tear will he cost you.</p>
    <p class=l>soon may thy aged cheeks in tears be drown’d,<br />and all the eyes of ilion stream around.</p>

    <p class=r>with this achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep of</p>
    <p class=l>he said, and, rising, chose the victim ewe</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>silvery whiteness, which his followers skinned and made ready all<br />in due order.</p>
    <p class=l>with silver fleece, which his attendants slew.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces,</p>
    <p class=l>the limbs they sever from the reeking hide,<br />with skill prepare them, and in parts divide:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spitted them, and drew them off again when they were well</p>
    <p class=l>each on the coals the separate morsels lays,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>roasted.</p>
    <p class=l>and, hasty, snatches from the rising blaze.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>automedon brought bread in fair baskets and served it</p>
    <p class=l>with bread the glittering canisters they load,<br />which round the board automedon bestow’d.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>round the table, while achilles dealt out the meat, and they laid</p>
    <p class=l>the chief himself to each his portion placed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>their hands on the good things that were before them.</p>
    <p class=l>and each indulging shared in sweet repast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as soon as</p>
    <p class=l>when now the rage of hunger was repress’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they had had enough to eat and drink, priam, descendant of</p>
    <p class=l>the wondering hero eyes his royal guest:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>dardanus, marvelled at the strength and beauty of achilles for he</p>
    <p class=l>no less the royal guest the hero eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was as a god to see, and achilles marvelled at priam as he</p>
    <p class=l>his godlike aspect and majestic size;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>listened to him and looked upon his noble presence.</p>
    <p class=l>here, youthful grace and noble fire engage;<br />and there, the mild benevolence of age.<br />thus gazing long, the silence neither broke,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they had</p>
    <p class=l>(a solemn scene!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gazed their fill priam spoke first.</p>
    <p class=l>) at length the father spoke:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“and now, o king,” he said,<br />“take me to my couch that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed</p>
    <p class=l>“permit me now, beloved of jove!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>boon of sleep.</p>
    <p class=l>to steep<br />my careful temples in the dew of sleep:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>never once have my eyes been closed from the day</p>
    <p class=l>for, since the day that number’d with the dead</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>your hands took the life of my son; i have grovelled without</p>
    <p class=l>my hapless son, the dust has been my bed;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ceasing in the mire of my stable-yard, making moan and brooding</p>
    <p class=l>soft sleep a stranger to my weeping eyes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>over my countless sorrows.</p>
    <p class=l>my only food, my sorrows and my sighs!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>now, moreover, i have eaten bread and</p>
    <p class=l>till now, encouraged by the grace you give,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drunk wine; hitherto i have tasted nothing.</p>

    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as he spoke achilles told his men and the women servants to set<br />beds in the room that was in the gatehouse, and make them with</p>
    <p class=l>with that, achilles bade prepare the bed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>good red rugs, and spread coverlets on the top of them with<br />woollen cloaks for priam and idaeus to wear.</p>
    <p class=l>with purple soft and shaggy carpets spread;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so the maids went</p>
    <p class=l>forth, by the flaming lights, they bend their way,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>out carrying a torch and got the two beds ready in all haste.</p>
    <p class=l>and place the couches, and the coverings lay.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then achilles said laughingly to priam, “dear sir, you shall lie</p>
    <p class=l>then he: “now, father, sleep, but sleep not here;<br />consult thy safety, and forgive my fear,<br />lest any argive, at this hour awake,</p>

    <p class=l>the king of men the ransom might defer;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and now tell me and tell me</p>
    <p class=l>but say with speed, if aught of thy desire</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>true, for how many days would you celebrate the funeral rites of</p>

    <p class=l>to inter thy hector?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and priam answered, “since, then, you suffer me to bury my noble</p>

    <p class=r>attendant sleep there in the forecourt, full of thought, while<br />achilles lay in an inner room of the house, with fair briseis by</p>

    <p class=l>the king’s return revolving in his mind,<br />to pass the ramparts, and the watch to blind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>strong force of sentinels.<br />he hovered therefore over priam’s head</p>
    <p class=l>the power descending hover’d o’er his head:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and said, “sir, now that achilles has spared your life, you seem</p>
    <p class=l>“and sleep’st thou, father!<br />(thus the vision said:)<br />now dost thou sleep, when hector is restored?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to have no fear about sleeping in the thick of your foes.</p>
    <p class=l>nor fear the grecian foes, or grecian lord?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you</p>
    <p class=l>thy presence here should stern atrides see,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have paid a great ransom, and have received the body of your son;<br />were you still alive and a prisoner the sons whom you have left</p>
    <p class=l>thy still surviving sons may sue for thee;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at home would have to give three times as much to free you; and</p>
    <p class=l>may offer all thy treasures yet contain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so it would be if agamemnon and the other achaeans were to know</p>
    <p class=l>to spare thy age; and offer all in vain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of your being here.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when he heard this the old man was afraid and roused his servant.</p>
    <p class=l>waked with the word the trembling sire arose,<br />and raised his friend: the god before him goes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mercury then yoked their horses and mules, and drove them quickly</p>
    <p class=l>he joins the mules, directs them with his hand,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>through the host so that no man perceived them.</p>
    <p class=l>and moves in silence through the hostile land.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they came to</p>
    <p class=l>when now to xanthus’ yellow stream they drove,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ford of eddying xanthus, begotten of immortal jove, mercury</p>
    <p class=l>(xanthus, immortal progeny of jove,)<br />the winged deity forsook their view,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>went back to high olympus, and dawn in robe of saffron began to</p>
    <p class=l>and in a moment to olympus flew.<br />now shed aurora round her saffron ray,<br />sprang through the gates of light, and gave the day:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>break over all the land.<br />priam and idaeus then drove on toward<br />the city lamenting and making moan, and the mules drew the body</p>
    <p class=l>charged with the mournful load, to ilion go</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of hector.</p>
    <p class=l>the sage and king, majestically slow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>no one neither man nor woman saw them, till cassandra,<br />fair as golden venus standing on pergamus, caught sight of her<br />dear father in his chariot, and his servant that was the city’s</p>
    <p class=l>cassandra first beholds, from ilion’s spire,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>herald with him.</p>
    <p class=l>the sad procession of her hoary sire;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then she saw him that was lying upon the bier,</p>
    <p class=l>then, as the pensive pomp advanced more near,<br />(her breathless brother stretched upon the bier,)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>drawn by the mules, and with a loud cry she went about the city</p>
    <p class=l>a shower of tears o’erflows her beauteous eyes,<br />alarming thus all ilion with her cries:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>saying, “come hither trojans, men and women, and look on hector;</p>
    <p class=l>“turn here your steps, and here your eyes employ,<br />ye wretched daughters, and ye sons of troy!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>if ever you rejoiced to see him coming from battle when he was</p>
    <p class=l>if e’er ye rush’d in crowds, with vast delight,<br />to hail your hero glorious from the fight,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alive, look now on him that was the glory of our city and all our</p>
    <p class=l>now meet him dead, and let your sorrows flow;<br />your common triumph, and your common woe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>people.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>at this there was not man nor woman left in the city, so great a</p>
    <p class=l>in thronging crowds they issue to the plains;<br />nor man nor woman in the walls remains;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>sorrow had possessed them.</p>
    <p class=l>in every face the self-same grief is shown;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hard by the gates they met priam as he</p>
    <p class=l>and troy sends forth one universal groan.<br />at scæa’s gates they meet the mourning wain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>was bringing in the body.</p>
    <p class=l>hang on the wheels, and grovel round the slain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>hector’s wife and his mother were the</p>
    <p class=l>the wife and mother, frantic with despair,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>first to mourn him: they flew towards the waggon and laid their<br />hands upon his head, while the crowd stood weeping round them.</p>
    <p class=l>kiss his pale cheek, and rend their scatter’d hair:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they would have stayed before the gates, weeping and lamenting</p>
    <p class=l>thus wildly wailing, at the gates they lay;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the livelong day to the going down of the sun, had not priam</p>
    <p class=l>and there had sigh’d and sorrow’d out the day;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>spoken to them from the chariot and said, “make way for the mules</p>
    <p class=l>but godlike priam from the chariot rose:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>to pass you.</p>
    <p class=l>“forbear (he cried) this violence of woes;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>afterwards when i have taken the body home you shall</p>
    <p class=l>first to the palace let the car proceed,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>have your fill of weeping.</p>
    <p class=l>then pour your boundless sorrows o’er the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>on this the people stood asunder, and made a way for the waggon.</p>
    <p class=l>the waves of people at his word divide,<br />slow rolls the chariot through the following tide;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when they had borne the body within the house they laid it upon a</p>
    <p class=l>even to the palace the sad pomp they wait:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bed and seated minstrels round it to lead the dirge, whereon the</p>
    <p class=l>they weep, and place him on the bed of state.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>women joined in the sad music of their lament.</p>
    <p class=l>a melancholy choir attend around,<br />with plaintive sighs, and music’s solemn sound:<br />alternately they sing, alternate flow<br />the obedient tears, melodious in their woe.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>foremost among</p>
    <p class=l>while deeper sorrows groan from each full heart,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them all andromache led their wailing as she clasped the head of</p>
    <p class=l>and nature speaks at every pause of art.<br />first to the corse the weeping consort flew;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>mighty hector in her embrace.</p>
    <p class=l>around his neck her milk-white arms she threw,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“husband,” she cried, “you have</p>
    <p class=l>“and oh, my hector!<br />oh, my lord!<br />(she cries)<br />snatch’d in thy bloom from these desiring eyes!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>died young, and leave me in your house a widow; he of whom we are</p>
    <p class=l>thou to the dismal realms for ever gone!<br />and i abandon’d, desolate, alone!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the ill-starred parents is still a mere child, and i fear he may</p>
    <p class=l>an only son, once comfort of our pains,<br />sad product now of hapless love, remains!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>not reach manhood.</p>
    <p class=l>never to manly age that son shall rise,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>ere he can do so our city will be razed and</p>
    <p class=l>or with increasing graces glad my eyes:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>overthrown, for you who watched over it are no more—you who were</p>
    <p class=l>for ilion now (her great defender slain)<br />shall sink a smoking ruin on the plain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>its saviour, the guardian of our wives and children.</p>
    <p class=l>who now protects her wives with guardian care?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>our women</p>
    <p class=l>who saves her infants from the rage of war?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>will be carried away captives to the ships, and i among them;</p>
    <p class=l>now hostile fleets must waft those infants o’er<br />(those wives must wait them) to a foreign shore:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>while you, my child, who will be with me will be put to some</p>
    <p class=l>thou too, my son, to barbarous climes shall go,<br />the sad companion of thy mother’s woe;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>unseemly tasks, working for a cruel master.</p>
    <p class=l>driven hence a slave before the victor’s sword</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>or, may be, some<br />achaean will hurl you (o miserable death) from our walls, to</p>
    <p class=l>condemn’d to toil for some inhuman lord:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>avenge some brother, son, or father whom hector slew; many of</p>
    <p class=l>or else some greek whose father press’d the plain,<br />or son, or brother, by great hector slain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>them have indeed bitten the dust at his hands, for your father’s<br />hand in battle was no light one.</p>
    <p class=l>in hector’s blood his vengeance shall enjoy,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore do the people mourn</p>
    <p class=l>and hurl thee headlong from the towers of troy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>him.</p>
    <p class=l>[297]</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>you have left, o hector, sorrow unutterable to your parents,</p>
    <p class=l>for thy stern father never spared a foe:<br />thence all these tears, and all this scene of woe!<br />thence many evils his sad parents bore,<br />his parents many, but his consort more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and my own grief is greatest of all, for you did not stretch</p>
    <p class=l>why gav’st thou not to me thy dying hand?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forth your arms and embrace me as you lay dying, nor say to me</p>
    <p class=l>and why received not i thy last command?</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>any words that might have lived with me in my tears night and day</p>
    <p class=l>some word thou would’st have spoke, which, sadly dear,<br />my soul might keep, or utter with a tear;<br />which never, never could be lost in air,<br />fix’d in my heart, and oft repeated there!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>for evermore.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>bitterly did she weep the while, and the women joined in her</p>
    <p class=l>thus to her weeping maids she makes her moan,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>lament.<br />hecuba in her turn took up the strains of woe.</p>
    <p class=l>her weeping handmaids echo groan for groan.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“hector,”</p>
    <p class=l>the mournful mother next sustains her part:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she cried, “dearest to me of all my children.</p>
    <p class=l>“o thou, the best, the dearest to my heart!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>so long as you were</p>
    <p class=l>of all my race thou most by heaven approved,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>alive the gods loved you well, and even in death they have not</p>
    <p class=l>and by the immortals even in death beloved!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>been utterly unmindful of you; for when achilles took any other</p>
    <p class=l>while all my other sons in barbarous bands</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of my sons, he would sell him beyond the seas, to samos imbrus or</p>
    <p class=l>achilles bound, and sold to foreign lands,<br />this felt no chains, but went a glorious ghost,<br />free, and a hero, to the stygian coast.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>rugged lemnos; and when he had slain you too with his sword, many</p>
    <p class=l>sentenced, ’tis true, by his inhuman doom,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>a time did he drag you round the sepulchre of his comrade—though</p>
    <p class=l>thy noble corse was dragg’d around the tomb;<br />(the tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain;)</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>this could not give him life—yet here you lie all fresh as dew,</p>
    <p class=l>ungenerous insult, impotent and vain!<br />yet glow’st thou fresh with every living grace;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>and comely as one whom apollo has slain with his painless</p>
    <p class=l>no mark of pain, or violence of face:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>shafts.</p>
    <p class=l>rosy and fair!<br />as phœbus’ silver bow<br />dismiss’d thee gently to the shades below.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus did she too speak through her tears with bitter moan, and</p>
    <p class=l>thus spoke the dame, and melted into tears.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then helen for a third time took up the strain of lamentation.</p>
    <p class=l>sad helen next in pomp of grief appears;<br />fast from the shining sluices of her eyes<br />fall the round crystal drops, while thus she cries.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“hector,” said she, “dearest of all my brothers-in-law—for i am</p>
    <p class=l>“ah, dearest friend!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wife to alexandrus who brought me hither to troy—would that i had</p>
    <p class=l>in whom the gods had join’d[298]<br />the mildest manners with the bravest mind,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>died ere he did so—twenty years are come and gone since i left my</p>
    <p class=l>now twice ten years (unhappy years) are o’er<br />since paris brought me to the trojan shore,<br />(o had i perish’d, ere that form divine<br />seduced this soft, this easy heart of mine!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>home and came from over the sea, but i have never heard one word</p>
    <p class=l>)<br />yet was it ne’er my fate, from thee to find</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of insult or unkindness from you.</p>
    <p class=l>a deed ungentle, or a word unkind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>when another would chide with</p>
    <p class=l>when others cursed the authoress of their woe,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me, as it might be one of your brothers or sisters or of your</p>
    <p class=l>thy pity check’d my sorrows in their flow.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>brothers’ wives, or my mother-in-law—for priam was as kind to me</p>
    <p class=l>if some proud brother eyed me with disdain,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>as though he were my own father—you would rebuke and check them</p>
    <p class=l>or scornful sister with her sweeping train,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>with words of gentleness and goodwill.</p>
    <p class=l>thy gentle accents soften’d all my pain.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>therefore my tears flow</p>
    <p class=l>for thee i mourn, and mourn myself in thee,<br />the wretched source of all this misery.<br />the fate i caused, for ever i bemoan;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>both for you and for my unhappy self, for there is no one else in</p>
    <p class=l>sad helen has no friend, now thou art gone!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>troy who is kind to me, but all shrink and shudder as they go by</p>
    <p class=l>through troy’s wide streets abandon’d shall i roam!<br />in troy deserted, as abhorr’d at home!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>me.<br />”</p>
    <p class=l>”</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>she wept as she spoke and the vast crowd that was gathered round</p>
    <p class=l>so spoke the fair, with sorrow-streaming eye.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>her joined in her lament.</p>
    <p class=l>distressful beauty melts each stander-by.<br />on all around the infectious sorrow grows;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then king priam spoke to them saying,</p>
    <p class=l>but priam check’d the torrent as it rose:</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>“bring wood, o trojans, to the city, and fear no cunning ambush</p>
    <p class=l>“perform, ye trojans!</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the argives, for achilles when he dismissed me from the ships</p>
    <p class=l>what the rites require,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>gave me his word that they should not attack us until the morning</p>
    <p class=l>and fell the forests for a funeral pyre;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>of the twelfth day.</p>
    <p class=l>twelve days, nor foes nor secret ambush dread;<br />achilles grants these honours to the dead.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>”</p>
    <p class=l>”[299]<br />[illustration: ] funeral of hector</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>forthwith they yoked their oxen and mules and gathered together</p>
    <p class=l>he spoke, and, at his word, the trojan train<br />their mules and oxen harness to the wain,<br />pour through the gates, and fell’d from ida’s crown,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>before the city.</p>
    <p class=l>roll back the gather’d forests to the town.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>nine days long did they bring in great heaps of</p>
    <p class=l>these toils continue nine succeeding days,<br />and high in air a sylvan structure raise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wood, and on the morning of the tenth day with many tears they</p>
    <p class=l>but when the tenth fair morn began to shine,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>took brave hector forth, laid his dead body upon the summit of</p>
    <p class=l>forth to the pile was borne the man divine,<br />and placed aloft; while all, with streaming eyes,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>the pile, and set the fire thereto.</p>
    <p class=l>beheld the flames and rolling smokes arise.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then when the child of</p>
    <p class=l>soon as aurora, daughter of the dawn,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared on the eleventh day, the</p>
    <p class=l>with rosy lustre streak’d the dewy lawn,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>people again assembled, round the pyre of mighty hector.<br />when</p>
    <p class=l>again the mournful crowds surround the pyre,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>they were got together, they first quenched the fire with wine</p>
    <p class=l>and quench with wine the yet remaining fire.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>wherever it was burning, and then his brothers and comrades with</p>
    <p class=l>the snowy bones his friends and brothers place</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>many a bitter tear gathered his white bones, wrapped them in soft</p>
    <p class=l>(with tears collected) in a golden vase;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>robes of purple, and laid them in a golden urn, which they placed</p>
    <p class=l>the golden vase in purple palls they roll’d,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>in a grave and covered over with large stones set close together.</p>
    <p class=l>of softest texture, and inwrought with gold.</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>then they built a barrow hurriedly over it keeping guard on every<br />side lest the achaeans should attack them before they had<br />finished.<br />when they had heaped up the barrow they went back again<br />into the city, and being well assembled they held high feast in<br />the house of priam their king.</p>
    <p class=l>last o’er the urn the sacred earth they spread,</p>

    <hr />
    <p class=r>thus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of hector tamer of</p>
    <p class=l>and raised the tomb, memorial of the dead.</p>

    <p class=r>horses.</p>
    <p class=l>(strong guards and spies, till all the rites were done,</p>
